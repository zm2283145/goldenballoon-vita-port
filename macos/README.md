# macOS release packaging

The 1.2.1 patch release intentionally skips Developer ID signing and
notarization. It is still sealed with an ad-hoc signature after every bundle
mutation. That signature provides the code/resource integrity Apple silicon
requires; it is not a trust signature. Players should see macOS's normal
unidentified-developer warning on first open, never a “damaged” app error.

## Unsigned 1.2.1 release (default)

Build only from a clean release commit. The provenance sidecar names `HEAD`, so
stamping an artifact made from uncommitted source would be dishonest.

```bash
set -euo pipefail
if [[ -n "$(git status --porcelain=v1 --untracked-files=all)" ]]; then
  echo "release build requires a clean tracked, staged, and untracked tree" >&2
  exit 1
fi

RELEASE_VERSION=1.2.1
SOURCE_COMMIT="$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
source ./macos/Scripts/release_sdl2_config.sh
SDL_PREFIX="$PWD/build-macos-deps/sdl2-${MDKR_RELEASE_SDL2_VERSION}/install"

./macos/Scripts/build_release_sdl2.sh \
  --work-dir "build-macos-deps/sdl2-${MDKR_RELEASE_SDL2_VERSION}" \
  --prefix "$SDL_PREFIX" \

./macos/Scripts/verify_unsigned_release.sh \
  --version "$RELEASE_VERSION" \
  --commit "$SOURCE_COMMIT" \
  "dist/Golden Balloon.app"

DMG_PATH="dist/Golden-Balloon-${RELEASE_VERSION}-macos-arm64-unsigned.dmg"
./macos/Scripts/create_dmg.sh "dist/Golden Balloon.app" "$DMG_PATH"
./macos/Scripts/verify_unsigned_dmg.sh \
  --version "$RELEASE_VERSION" --commit "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" "$DMG_PATH"
./macos/Scripts/stamp_macos_provenance.sh \
  --signing ad-hoc-unsigned "$DMG_PATH" "$RELEASE_VERSION"
(
  cd "$(dirname "$DMG_PATH")"
  DMG_NAME="$(basename "$DMG_PATH")"
  shasum -a 256 "$DMG_NAME" > "$DMG_NAME.sha256"
)
```

The untracked-file check is release-critical: CMake discovers native app-shell
translation units under `platform/app/`, so an untracked source file must not
enter a binary whose provenance names the committed `HEAD`.

`build_release_sdl2.sh` downloads the official SDL2 2.32.10 archive and checks
its pinned SHA-256 before extraction. It builds a real standalone SDL2 dylib
for macOS 13. The packager rejects Homebrew's `sdl2-compat` shim because that
shim loads SDL3 dynamically and copying the shim alone creates a bundle that
only works on machines where SDL3 happens to be installed.

The final verifier checks the nested signatures and resource seal, every Mach-O
architecture/minimum-OS/load-path contract, compiled and plist versions,
compiled source commit, asset-free policy, WebGPU default startup, a real
launcher pixel capture, and the absence of Homebrew or SDL3 runtime loads.
At runtime the sealed `Contents/Resources` tree is addressed only as an
immutable absolute resource root. Video configuration and game saves live under
`SDL_GetPrefPath("mdkr64", "mdkr64")`; the app never changes into Resources or
writes through its signature seal.
The DMG filename ends in `-unsigned.dmg`, and its provenance sidecar records
`"macos_signing": "ad-hoc-unsigned"`; neither can be mistaken for a notarized
Developer ID build.

The equivalent protected workflow command is:

```bash
gh workflow run macos-release.yml \
  -f version=1.2.1 \
  -f trusted_signing=false
```

Leave `release_tag` empty while producing a test artifact. Publishing is
allowed only when it is exactly `v1.2.1` and that tag resolves to the workflow's
source commit; both the package and publish jobs enforce that binding.

## Human candidate play-test

Do this against the exact DMG and its two sidecars produced above, before
tagging or publishing anything:

1. In the artifact directory, run
   `shasum -a 256 -c Golden-Balloon-1.2.1-macos-arm64-unsigned.dmg.sha256`.
2. Open the DMG and drag `Golden Balloon.app` into a new, empty test folder. Launch that
   copy from Finder, with no `MDKR_RENDERER` environment override.
3. If macOS blocks the unidentified developer, first attempt the launch, then
   open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, choose **Open Anyway**, and
   confirm **Open**. A “damaged” message is a hard failure.
4. Open the launcher's **Diagnostics** panel and confirm `Renderer: webgpu`.
   Select a supported ROM and verify the intro, title screen, menus, and a race
   have no fractured sky/terrain or repeated-logo corruption.
5. Confirm the frame limit initially reads **Original**. Exercise one numeric
   limit and **Uncapped**, then return to **Original**; neither transition may
   crash, accelerate gameplay, corrupt the image, or leave audio/input changed.

Keep the release tag and publication step blocked until this exact copied app
passes. The automated mounted-DMG LaunchServices/WebGPU check is mandatory, but
it does not replace this final human gameplay check.

## Optional trusted release

The Developer ID/notarization path remains available for a later release. Set
up the protected `macos-release` environment with a **Developer ID Application**
certificate and App Store Connect team API key, then dispatch:

```bash
gh workflow run macos-release.yml \
  -f version=1.2.1 \
  -f trusted_signing=true
```

Required environment secrets are `MACOS_CERTIFICATE_P12_BASE64`,
`MACOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_API_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64`,
`APPLE_API_KEY_ID`, and `APPLE_API_ISSUER_ID`. Set
`DEVELOPER_ID_APPLICATION` to the exact certificate name. Keep all credentials
outside the repository and rotate them immediately if exposed.

With `trusted_signing=true`, the workflow signs nested code and the app with
Developer ID + Hardened Runtime, notarizes and staples the app, signs and
notarizes the DMG, and requires Gatekeeper acceptance. There is no
`--skip-notarize` path in the workflow. For 1.2.1, that optional artifact is
exactly `Golden-Balloon-1.2.1-macos-arm64-signed-notarized.dmg` and records
`developer-id-notarized` in provenance.

Gatekeeper acceptance is a static trust check, not a renderer smoke. Before a
trusted artifact can be published, run a dedicated **post-sign and post-staple**
LaunchServices test against the final app that requires the same WebGPU-default
four-present/capture telemetry and standalone-SDL runtime-load audit as the
unsigned verifier. `verify_unsigned_release.sh` intentionally rejects a trusted
authority, so it cannot stand in for that signed-runtime gate. The protected
workflow's signed lane is not release-qualified until that final runtime gate
is implemented and passes; do not infer runtime health from the earlier
ad-hoc-bundle smoke. The workflow enforces this itself: a dispatch that combines
`trusted_signing=true` with a non-empty `release_tag` is rejected in the
input-validation step, so a trusted artifact can be produced for inspection but
not published.
