# Single source of truth for the standalone SDL2 used by macOS releases.
# Consumers must continue to verify both the source archive and installed
# license bytes; these constants identify the authenticated inputs.
#
# This file is sourced, never executed: it declares readonly constants and runs
# no command. It deliberately sets no shell options -- the sourcing script owns
# `set -euo pipefail`, and setting them here would silently change the caller's
# shell.

# Values are intentionally consumed only by scripts that source this file.
