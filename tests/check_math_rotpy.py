"""vec3f_rotate_py() must pair pitch with yaw, not each angle with itself.

The bug this locks down
-----------------------
`vec3f_rotate_py()` (game/src/hasm/math_util.c) turns a pitch/yaw pair into a
direction vector.  The upstream NON_MATCHING C body had the two angles
**transposed** in the x and y results:

    vec->x = z * cosY * sinX;      /* WRONG */
    vec->y = -z * sinY;            /* WRONG */
    vec->z = z * cosX * cosY;      /* right */

The ROM computes `x = z*cos(pitch)*sin(yaw)`, `y = -z*sin(pitch)`.
`LEAF(vec3f_rotate_py)` in game/src/hasm/ido/math_util.s (ROM 0x800706D0) loads
the pitch first and the yaw second:

    lh    a0, 0x2(a2)     # pitch
    jal   sins_f
    mul.s ft1, ft2, fv0   # ft1 = z * sin(pitch)
    lh    a0, 0x2(a2)     # pitch
    jal   coss_f
    neg.s ft1             # y   = -z * sin(pitch)
    mul.s ft2, fv0        # z1  =  z * cos(pitch)
    lh    a0, 0x0(a2)     # yaw
    jal   sins_f
    mul.s ft0, ft2, fv0   # x   = z1 * sin(yaw)
    lh    a0, 0x0(a2)     # yaw
    jal   coss_f
    mul.s ft2, fv0        # z   = z1 * cos(yaw)

The offsets are what settle it, not the .s comments: `Vec3s`
(game/include/structs.h:51) is a union whose rotation view puts `y_rotation` at
0x0 and `x_rotation` at 0x2.  So the pair loaded FIRST (0x2) is the pitch.  The
.s labels 0x0 "roll", which is what the transposition was copied from.

The matching N64 build takes `GLOBAL_ASM("asm/math_util/vec3f_rotate_py.s")`, so
upstream never compiles that C body.  This port builds with NON_MATCHING=1, which
makes us the first to run it.

Why it is silent
----------------
Every call site feeds the result straight into a position or a velocity, so a
wrong direction still moves something plausibly -- nothing crashes and nothing
logs.  The magnitude is not subtle, though: with pitch 0 and yaw 90 degrees the
ROM returns (z, 0, 0) and the transposed version returns (0, -z, 0), i.e. a
horizontal direction becomes a vertical one.  Call sites are particle emission
(particles.c:1163/1165/1214/2393), the lens flare (weather.c:631), spotlight
direction (lights.c:413) and object sprite placement (objects.c:493).

Why the check works this way
----------------------------
Both arms come from the SAME binary: `MDKR_ROTPY=legacy` restores the
transposition verbatim (platform/math_util_native.c), so the broken arm is
re-produced on every run and has to actually *exhibit* the defect before the
fixed arm is credited.  Three independent things are asserted:

1. **An oracle that needs no golden numbers.**  `vec3f_rotate_py` is by its own
   docstring `vec3f_rotate` specialised to (0, 0, z) with zero roll, and
   `vec3f_rotate` matches its own assembly (audited separately).  The self-test
   runs both on the same inputs and prints both.  They agree only with the fix.
   This assertion does not depend on anyone's reading of the assembly.
2. **The ROM's formula**, evaluated here in Python from the instruction sequence
   quoted above.
3. **Reachability**, because the fix is behaviour-neutral for the racer
   simulation -- measured 0 of 359 [PACE] rows changed, since no call site feeds
   physics -- so a [PACE] diff could never show the code runs.  The probe counts
   calls and folds every result into a hash instead; the arms must differ.
