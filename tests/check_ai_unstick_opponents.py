"""CPU opponents must always get their stuck-recovery back.

What was unmeasured
-------------------
`racer_AI_pathing_inputs()` (game/src/racer.c) is the AI's whole recovery from
"I have driven into something and stopped": after 60 update units of standing
still it kicks the kart into a 60-unit reverse, advances to a different AI node,
and arms a 120-unit cooldown so the recovery cannot re-fire immediately.

    if (racer->unk214 == 0 && racer->velocity < -0.5) {   /* decay */
        racer->unk215 -= updateRate;
        ...
    }
    if (racer->velocity > -1.0 && racer->unk214 == 0 && !gRaceStartTimer && ... &&
        racer->unk215 == 0) {                             /* re-arm gate */
        racer->unk213 += updateRate;
        if (racer->unk213 > 60) { racer->unk214 = 60; racer->unk215 = 120; ... }
    }

The cooldown decays on ONE condition. Note the sign: `racer->velocity` is
NEGATIVE for forward motion (`racer.c` assigns `racer->velocity = -sqrtf(...)`;
the boss animation picks RUN at `velocity < -2.0`), measured at about -11 for an
opponent driving a clean lap and POSITIVE while the AI's own reverse-out state
is running. So `unk214 == 0 && velocity < -0.5` means "the reverse window has
expired AND the kart is back to driving forward at speed" -- not "the kart is
reversing", which is how docs/open-items/gameplay.md read it until this witness
measured it. The conclusion is the same either way, because a kart that cannot
move satisfies neither.

Nothing else in racer.c reads or writes `unk215`. So a kart that comes out of
the reverse window still unable to move has an armed cooldown that can never
reach zero, and a recovery gated on `unk215 == 0` that can therefore never fire
again. It is stuck for the rest of the race.

That is not hypothetical: it is measured, on the AUTOPILOTED HUMAN, at Hot Top
Volcano's crater jump -- 18,677 frames motionless -- and is why
`mdkr_autopilot_unstick()` (platform/mdkr_adventure.c, `MDKR_AUTOPILOT_UNSTICK`)
exists at all. See docs/open-items/gameplay.md.

What was NOT measured is the case that decides how that item is classified: a
GENUINE OPPONENT. The unstick helper is reachable only from the human-autopilot
limb of update_player_racer(), so a real CPU racer has no recovery whatsoever --
if the same wedge is reachable for opponents, every player who races Hot Top
Volcano can watch a rival stand still for two laps, and the item is a
player-visible defect rather than a test-harness inconvenience. It had never
been observed on an opponent, but "never observed" was a statement about where
anyone had looked.

Where the opponents actually are
--------------------------------
Worth stating because it is easy to get wrong from a grep:
update_player_racer()'s `} else { racer_AI_pathing_inputs(...); }` is NOT the
opponent path. It sits inside

    if (tempRacer->playerIndex == PLAYER_COMPUTER) {
        update_AI_racer(obj, tempRacer, updateRate, updateRateF);
    } else {
        ... 200 lines, including that input dispatch ...
    }

so it is reached only by a HUMAN kart that the finish/menu hand-off has already
relabelled PLAYER_COMPUTER. Genuine opponents run `update_AI_racer()`, which
calls `racer_AI_pathing_inputs()` while `racer->unk201 != 0`. The witness this
check reads is installed there, and refuses any racer index ever seen carrying a
real player index.

The measurement
---------------
`MDKR_AI_STUCK_TRACE=<stride>` (game/src/racer.c, inert unless set, deliberately
NOT folded into MDKR_TRACE -- see the "shipping configuration" note below) emits,
for every opponent:

  [AISTUCKEV] ... event=arm    the cooldown went 0 -> 120: a recovery fired
  [AISTUCKEV] ... event=clear  the cooldown reached 0 again, with the peaks
  [AISTUCK]   ... every <stride> ticks, the live state

and maintains two per-opponent counters, both in update-rate units:

  stall    consecutive units with the cooldown armed while |velocity| < 0.5 --
           the exact predicate under which the decay branch cannot be taken
           because the kart is not moving. This is the wedge signature.
  nodecay  consecutive units with the cooldown armed and the decay branch's own
           condition false. Legitimately covers the entire reverse window, so it
           is the loose bound; `stall` is the tight one.

Both reset the moment the kart finishes: a racer parked on the results
choreography is not evidence about the recovery loop.

Where the wedge window comes from
---------------------------------
Measured, not chosen. 32 Hot Top Volcano races across 32 distinct boot RNG seeds
produced 23 legitimate stuck-then-recover episodes on genuine opponents. Every
one of them cleared -- 23 `arm` events, 23 `clear` events, none left armed at the
end of a run. Their peaks:

    stall    2 x8, 3 x8, 4, 6, 7 x3, 15, 229        (23 episodes, max 229)
    nodecay  65 .. 729
    armed    186 .. 1196 update units

The 229 is the interesting one and it is worth reading, because it is what makes
this gate's threshold defensible rather than arbitrary. Opponent 6 left the track
at (-96.1, -987.7, 2357.9), all wheels off a surface, velocity pinned at 0.472 --
below the 0.5 the decay branch needs, in the direction that cannot satisfy it
either -- with the cooldown at its full 120 and the reverse window already
expired. That is the wedge, exactly: 208 update units of a kart that cannot
re-arm its own recovery. It did not stay wedged, because DKR's own
out-of-bounds respawn put it back on the track at tick 14790, after which the
cooldown decayed 120 -> 114 -> 84 -> 54 -> 24 -> 0 in six samples of ordinary
forward driving. The respawn is the opponent's recovery. The human autopilot at
the crater lands INSIDE the world, grounded, so respawn never triggers for it --
which is why the same track wedges the autopilot and not the field.

So the window is set at 4x the observed legitimate maximum: an opponent whose
recovery is genuinely deadlocked has an UNBOUNDED counter (nothing else writes
`unk215`), so anything a real wedge produces will run past this within a second
or two of racing, while the longest legitimate episode ever measured uses a
quarter of it.

Shipping configuration
----------------------
This gate does not export `MDKR_TRACE`. That variable arms engine behaviour as
well as printing (`mdkr_resource_trace_enabled()`; wave "shadowdeep" R1 in
docs/open-items/renderer.md), so a measurement taken with it set is a
measurement of a different program. The witness has its own variable and the
only other thing this check sets is the route.

If this check FAILS
-------------------
Do not "fix" it by changing gameplay. `racer_AI_pathing_inputs()` is matching
decompiled code with no GLOBAL_ASM and no NON_MATCHING; whether the cooldown
should behave this way is an owner decision (preservation port vs. fix), and the
open item exists precisely to hold that decision. Report the telemetry.
