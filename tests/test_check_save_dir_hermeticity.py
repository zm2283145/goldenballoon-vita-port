"""Source gate: a check that scrubs MDKR* out of its engine environment must
put MDKR_SAVE_DIR back before it hands that environment to a process.

MECHANISM. Most behavioural checks build a "hermetic" engine environment by
dropping every inherited MDKR* variable. That scrub also drops the two
variables tools/run_checks.py exports per task: MDKR_SAVE_DIR and
MDKR_VIDEO_CONFIG_PATH. Since issue #54 unified save resolution, a
non-packaged build that sees no MDKR_SAVE_DIR no longer resolves saves to
$CWD/save -- it resolves them to the SHARED per-user directory
(~/Library/Application Support/mdkr64/mdkr64/save on macOS,
$XDG_DATA_HOME/mdkr64/save on Linux). Any adventure-in-progress EEPROM sitting
there -- left by a developer playing the game, or by an earlier suite task --
then re-routes the boot flow of every such check: FILE SELECT resumes instead
of starting a new game, the intro cutscene is skipped, levels load thousands of
frames early, frame-timed track-select inputs miss, and seeded unlock state is
ignored because the engine never reads the seed the check wrote. The failures
read as product regressions ("level never loaded ... no [PVEH]", "0 flap cues",
"trophies 0x0", "capture-window positions=0") and are entirely an artefact of
the host's shared directory.

The 1.6.0 fixture-remints wave fixed 22 lanes of this by hand and recorded that
the class is systemic: an aggregate like check_full_ubsan or check_native_layout
scrubs once and then hands that environment to a dozen SUB-checks
(check_vehicle_sweep, check_track_sweep, ...) which themselves inherit
os.environ faithfully -- so a sub-check that is correct on its own still lands
on the shared directory when its parent scrubbed. This gate is the audit that
wave asked for.

WHAT IT ACCEPTS. Inheriting an explicit MDKR_SAVE_DIR (dict(os.environ)) is
fine -- that is how the suite's per-task pin reaches a check. What is not fine
is destroying the pin and then launching. A scrubbed environment is repaired by
harness_utils.save_env(env, run_dir) (preferred: it pins the video config in
the same breath, which check_harness_isolation.py requires), by an explicit
env["MDKR_SAVE_DIR"] = ... assignment, or by passing MDKR_SAVE_DIR into the
call that builds it.
