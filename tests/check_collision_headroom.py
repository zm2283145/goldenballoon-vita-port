"""Per-level collision-candidate headroom, and a tripwire if it shrinks.

Background
----------
`generate_collision_candidates()` (game/src/hasm/collision.c) fills
`gCollisionCandidates[MAX_COLLISION_CANDIDATES]` (500 entries,
game/src/collision.h). Wave "boundsweep" (docs/open-items/collision.md) found
that the SEGMENT insert at the top of the outer loop advanced the write index
with no bound at all -- only the FACET insert's post-increment equality test
(`j == 500`) guarded anything, and an equality test cannot catch an index that
steps over it. It is fixed with a `j >= mdkr_coll_cap(MAX_COLLISION_CANDIDATES)`
pre-check at BOTH insert sites (this check's first assertion is that both are
still there).

That fix stops the overrun, but it does not add headroom: a saturated list
still silently DROPS every candidate past the cap, which is the exact mechanism
that dropped racers through Tricky's volcano in wave "gridmask" (an
over-permissive grid mask fed the list too many triangles). Measured peaks
today: 416 of 500 on boss levels 41 and 54 -- 84 slots of margin, the tightest
in the game. This follow-up is INSTRUMENT-ONLY: measure
and gate, not raise the cap -- the layout/perf effects of a larger allocation are
unmeasured, so a speculative raise is outside its scope.

What this check does
---------------------
1. Confirms the `j >= cap` guard source text is present at both insert sites
   (a static, cheap check that the fix this gate depends on has not regressed
   to the ROM's bare equality test), AND that each guard sits ABOVE the store it
   guards. Presence alone is not the property: the facet insert once carried its
   pre-check below its own store, which lets the segment insert hand it j == cap
   and puts one element at index cap.
2. Drives all ten boss levels (the tightest margins in the game) plus one
   ordinary race, one run each, MDKR_AUTOPILOT + MDKR_TRACE, and reads the
   `[COLL] maxCandidates=N truncated=N cap=N` line every route already emits
   (platform/platform_sdl_min.c, fed by platform/stubs_dkr.c
   mdkr_coll_candidates()). Fails if truncation happens in normal play (that is
   never survivable -- see wave "gridmask"), and fails if any level's high-water
   mark exceeds a frozen baseline ceiling (measured peak + a small slack), which
   is the regression tripwire: something that quietly widens the candidate list
   would move these numbers before it ever drops a candidate.
3. Positive control: MDKR_COLLCAP=<n> (platform/stubs_dkr.c, also used by
   check_array_bounds_sweep.py's own cap control) lowers the EFFECTIVE cap on
   boss level 41's own route -- same track, same script, same frame budget as
   row 41 in the table above, cap alone shrunk from 500 to 150, well under its
   natural 416 peak. This must (a) make the guard hold -- maxCandidates never
   exceeds the lowered cap, i.e. the fix from wave "boundsweep" is still doing
   its job -- and (b) make the run truncate, which is exactly the condition the
   step 2 "truncated must be 0" rule exists to catch. Evaluating that same rule
   against the forced run confirms it actually fires: the control is not
   vacuous.
4. Allocation-lowering control: MDKR_COLLCAP alone moves the boundary INSIDE a
   full-size 500-entry allocation, so a store at index == cap is unobservable --
   it is a real element of a real array. MDKR_COLLALLOC=1 (platform/stubs_dkr.c,
   game/src/tracks.c) lowers the ALLOCATION to the effective cap and arms a
   canary element at index == cap. That slot is the first one a missing or
   mis-ordered guard touches and one no correct path can reach, so
   `[COLL] canary=` must read 0. This is the arm that would have caught the
   facet insert's guard sitting below its store.

This does NOT raise MAX_COLLISION_CANDIDATES, touch generate_collision_candidates()
or compute_grid_overlap_mask(), or change gameplay in any way -- read-only
instrumentation plus a headless regression gate.
