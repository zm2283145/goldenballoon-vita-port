"""P3.1 check: finishing a TIME TRIAL must record a time to EEPROM.

Why this exists
---------------
"The player can drive but cannot complete a race and keep their time" was the
project's top open item.  Two things made it look like a broken finish path when
it was not:

  1. **No fixture ever enabled Time Trial.**  DKR writes course/lap records only
     from `race_finish_time_trial()`, whose whole body is gated on
     `if (gIsTimeTrial)` (game/src/objects.c).  Every existing race fixture ends
     its track-select navigation with "confirm TIME TRIAL = OFF", so the record
     write was unreachable by construction and no run could ever touch EEPROM.
     The fixture used here pushes the stick DOWN at the track-select Time-Trial
     stage first, so `set_time_trial_enabled(1)` runs (game/src/menu.c).
  2. **A solo Time Trial has no CPU racers**, and DKR's AI throttle routine
     returns early when the field contains none, so `MDKR_AUTOPILOT` steered but
     never accelerated.  See the hook in `update_player_racer` (game/src/racer.c).

`raceFinished` itself was always being set; a probe living *inside*
`update_player_racer` simply could not see it, because a finished racer moves to
a different update path.

What this asserts
-----------------
  1. **The race finishes.**  `rlap=` in the [PACE] trace reaches the level's lap
     count (3 on Ancient Lake) and `fin=` flips 0 -> 1.  Both come from
     `race_check_finish()`, i.e. from outside `update_player_racer` — the older
     `lap=`/`cp=` fields freeze one lap short because that function stops running
     for a racer as soon as it finishes.
  2. **A plausible time.**  The race clock freezes at the finish, and its final
     value (== the course time, the sum of the lap times) lands in a sane band
     for three autopilot laps.
  3. **The time reaches EEPROM.**  The run starts from a deleted `eeprom.bin`,
     so the file must be created, be a full 512 bytes, not be the all-zero image
     the game writes when it saves nothing, and the exact
     frozen clock value must appear in it as a 16-bit big-endian record.  Tying
     the assertion to the *measured* clock rather than a hardcoded offset means a
     byteswap or layout regression in the record serialiser fails the check.
  4. **It survives a restart.**  A second run of the same fixture must read the
     record back: it re-drives the identical (deterministic) time, which does not
     beat the stored one, so nothing is rewritten and the file is byte-identical.
     If the read-back path were broken the defaults would come back instead, the
     run would "set a new record", and the md5 would move.

Usage:
    tests/check_race_finish_time.py [--build build] [--rom baserom.us.v80.z64] [-v]

Always runs muted + headless (MDKR_AUDIO=0 and --headless-frames), per
tests/README.md.  Exit 0 = pass; exit 1 = at least one assertion failed (each
printed with the measured value).
