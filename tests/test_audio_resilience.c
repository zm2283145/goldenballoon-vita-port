/*
 * Closed-loop resilience contract for native audio delivery (issue #23).
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODELS
 *
 * The whole delivery path, in virtual time, using the REAL controller
 * (platform/audio_queue_controller.c) and the REAL sink ring
 * (platform/audio_ring.c):
 *
 *   - a host device that pulls one negotiated PERIOD of frames at a time on
 *     its own clock, exactly as SDL's audio thread does;
 *   - a producer that refills once per authored 2-field tick (33.33 ms), which
 *     is the cooperative main loop;
 *   - an injected frametime HITCH that delays some refills, which is what
 *     issue #23 reports and what a shader compile, level load or slow present
 *     really does.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A SIMULATION AND NOT A LIVE RUN
 *
 * Starvation is a race between two real clocks. A live headless run cannot
 * stage it: the engine free-runs far faster than real time, so the sink is
 * always deep and no hitch can empty it, while a live windowed run needs a
 * display and a real output device and is inherently timing-flaky. Virtual
 * time makes the same race exact, reproducible on every platform, and
 * bit-identical between runs -- and it is the only form in which the WASAPI /
 * PulseAudio / CoreAudio period differences can all be asserted from one host.
 *
 * NON-VACUITY IS PROVEN IN-TEST
 *
 * Every resilience case runs the identical schedule twice: once with the
 * delivery design this port shipped before the fix (queue-mode period, drain
 * inferred from elapsed time behind a stall guard, one synthesis call per
 * tick) and once with the current one. The legacy arm is asserted to STARVE
 * and the current arm to survive. A change that silently disabled the fix
 * would fail the second assertion; a test that could not detect starvation at
 * all would fail the first.
