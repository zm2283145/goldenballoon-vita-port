"""Wave "objcoll" check: a locked hub door must physically block the kart.

Why this exists
---------------
`func_80017A18()` is the per-facet object-model collision test — the only thing
that makes a collision-meshed object solid, and the ONLY non-NULL writer of
`collisionData->collidedObj` anywhere in the game.  Until wave "objcoll" it was a
`return 0` WEAK stub in `platform/hasm_stubs_temp.c`, because `objects.c` guarded
the body with `#ifdef NON_EQUIVALENT`.  So every collision-meshed object was
intangible, and the player could drive through a shut door into a world they had
not earned: `obj_loop_exit()` has no door check by design (a 253-unit sphere plus
a half-plane through the exit's own origin), so once past the leaf it warps you.

Measured with the legacy arm, on a clean EEPROM with **zero balloons**: the kart
reaches the Dino Domain lobby at frame ~6731 and *Ancient Lake* at ~7017, with
`balloons_total=0` and both gating doors reporting `open=0`.

This check is the reason the fix is falsifiable.  Its failure mode is **silence** —
you simply drive through, nothing crashes, no log line appears — so a check that
only ran the fixed build would prove nothing (CONTRIBUTING.md rule 2).  Both arms
therefore run from ONE binary via `MDKR_OBJCOLL=legacy`, which restores the stub's
`return 0`, exactly as `MDKR_COLLTEX=legacy` does for the untextured-batch case.

What this asserts
-----------------
  1. **FIXED ARM** — with collision live, the 0-balloon route must NOT reach the
     Dino Domain lobby (levelId 12) or Ancient Lake (levelId 5).  It must still
     reach Timber's Island (levelId 0), otherwise the route broke for some
     unrelated reason and the "did not pass the door" result is vacuous.
  2. **FIXED ARM** — object-model collision must report a non-zero number of hits
     (`[OBJCOLL] objectmodel_collision_hits`).  Without this the check would also
     pass if the kart simply never drove anywhere near the door.
  3. **LEGACY ARM (positive control)** — with `MDKR_OBJCOLL=legacy` the SAME route
     must reach levelId 12 and levelId 5, and must report **zero** collision hits.
     This is what proves assertion 1 is caused by the fix and not by the route.
  4. Both arms exit 0 with no `[CRASH]`/`[FATAL]`.

Note the asymmetry is deliberate: the fixed arm asserts a *negative* (cannot get
in), which is only meaningful next to the legacy arm's *positive* (could get in,
same route, same seed, same binary).

Usage:
    tests/check_door_blocks.py [--build build] [--rom baserom.us.v80.z64] [-v]

Always runs muted + headless (`MDKR_AUDIO=0` and `--headless-frames`), per
CONTRIBUTING.md's audio-safety rule.
