"""Draw distance and model detail move the picture and nothing else.

Why this exists
---------------
`Enhancements.DrawDistance` and `Enhancements.LodBias` are declared
`MDKR_ENH_PRESENTATION` in `platform/enhancement_registry.c`.
`tests/check_enhancement_authority.py` owns one half of that claim — that
neither can move the authoritative `[SIMHASH]` stream — but it drives
`nav_to_time_trial_race.txt`, which never leaves the menus, so for these two
rows its verdict is about the config key and not about the effect. This gate
owns the other half, in a race, where the effect is actually on screen.

The specific risk this gate exists for
--------------------------------------
DKR's draw distance is a RENDER-SIDE CULL. In this port the same predicate,
`check_if_in_draw_range()` in `game/src/tracks.c`, is reached from two places
with completely different authority: `scene_authoritative_render_tick()`, which
writes `obj->opacity` through it and gates `obj_authoritative_texture_tick()` on
it, and `render_level_geometry_and_objects()`, which only draws. Widen the
threshold in the first and "how far you can see" becomes an input to the
simulation — the enhancement is GAMEPLAY, not PRESENTATION, and it is wrong.

The assertion that tells those two apart is not "the frame changed" and it is
not even "the hash matched". It is **the live object count per tick is
identical**. An update-side cull changes which objects tick, which changes which
objects are spawned and destroyed, which moves `objs=` in the `[SIMHASH]` row.
A render-side cull cannot touch it. That assertion is the point of this file;
everything else is supporting evidence.

The arms
--------
Draw distance, on the deterministic single-player Time Trial route:

  dd100   `Enhancements.DrawDistance=100` — the authored distance
  dd400   `=400` — the previous top of the schema's range
  dd1600  `=1600` — the schema's "Maximum" notch (issue #47)

Draw distance, on the TWO-player split-screen route — the fixture the issue
actually reports against ("Joint Venture" runs 2P). `game/src/tracks.c`'s only
multiplayer draw-distance reduction (a 0.5x halving) applies solely to the
FOUR-player layout, so this pair exists to prove the setting also reaches the
draw in a layout that takes no such reduction, with the same purity invariants
as the single-player pair above:

  split100  `Enhancements.DrawDistance=100` on `race_2p_split.txt`
  split400  `=400` on `race_2p_split.txt`

Model detail, on the FOUR-player split-screen route. The racer LOD ladder is the
port's only distance-driven model selection, and the route has to be one where
the authored ladder actually chooses a reduced model, or a setting that holds
higher detail has nothing to hold. A Time Trial has one racer, always close to
its own camera and always already at model 0. Four-player split-screen is the
opposite end: its band table selects models 2 and 3, so the bias has somewhere
to go. This was measured, not assumed — see the `lodShifted` assertion below,
which fails rather than passes if the route stops exercising the ladder.

  lod0    `Enhancements.LodBias=0` — the authored ladder
  lod2    `=2` — hold the detailed model furthest out

What it asserts
---------------
1. `dd400`'s captured frame differs from `dd100`'s. The capture frame is chosen
   to be one where the setting actually admits objects, which the `[DRAWDIST]`
   row proves rather than assumes.

2. The two `[SIMHASH]` v3 streams are byte-identical.

3. **The live object count per tick is identical.** Compared explicitly, tick by
   tick, rather than left implicit inside the hash — a hash comparison that
   fails tells you something moved, and this gate needs to be able to say WHAT.

4. The `[DRAWDIST]` census shows the AUTHORED draw count per frame is unchanged
   between the two arms while the EXTENDED count is zero at 100% and nonzero at
   400%. This is the mechanical form of "the setting only adds": the frame
   difference in (1) is more objects being drawn, not a stray blend or a
   one-pixel scissor shift somewhere else.

5. `lod2` keeps the same `[SIMHASH]` stream and the same live object count per
   tick as `lod0`, the `[DRAWDIST]` census reports the bias actually landed on
   a different model (`lodShifted`) on the captured frame while `lod0` reports
   zero shifts on every frame of the route, and NEITHER arm ever presented a
   never-posed (bind-pose) instance (`drawnAnimationID=-1` in the
   MDKR_TEST_ANIM_LOD_WITNESS stream). On THIS 4P route the band table never
   commits models 0/1, so every model the bias holds is one
   `obj_animate_tick()` has never posed: the pixel difference the pre-fence
   build showed here was literally the T-pose defect. Post-fence the two
   captures are expected byte-identical — accepted only when the fence
   demonstrably redirected biased never-posed requests
   (`requestedAnimationID=-1` count > 0); an identical frame with an idle
   fence still fails as "the setting reached nothing". A differing frame (a
   posed instance the bias legitimately sharpened) also passes.
   `lodShifted` counts choices the bias CHANGED after the model range is
   clamped, not choices it was consulted about, so a bias that is read and
   then erased by the clamp reads as the zero it is.

6. `split400` admits extra objects (`extended > 0`) at the captured frame of the
   two-player race, the AUTHORED count is identical to `split100`'s there and
   over the whole route, and the two arms' `[SIMHASH]` v3 streams and live
   object counts are identical — the same shape as (1)-(4), reproduced on the
   fixture issue #47 was actually filed against, so a 2P-specific gap (the
   issue's hypothesis) cannot pass silently.

7. `dd1600` reaches a `scale` of 16.0 (not silently re-clamped to `dd400`'s 4.0)
   and draws at least as many objects at the capture frame as `dd400` does,
   while remaining an authored-count-identical, `[SIMHASH]`-identical extension
   of `dd100` — proving the schema's new top notch is still purely a render-side
   widening, not a new policy surface.

Vacuity guards, checked before anything else: an arm with no `[SIMHASH]` rows or
no `[DRAWDIST]` rows fails, because both instruments are opt-in and a run where
one did not arm would let every comparison below pass by comparing nothing.

Every run is muted (`MDKR_AUDIO=0`) and headless (`--headless-frames`).
