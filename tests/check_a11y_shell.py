"""Every control the shell offers must say what it is and what it is set to.

ImGui draws to a canvas and publishes no accessibility tree, so the app speaks
for itself: platform/app/ui_common.cpp announces the focused row, and
platform/a11y_model.c turns that into one `[SPEAK]` line per utterance under
MDKR_A11Y_TRACE=1. This gate walks the real UI by keyboard and reads them.

What makes it worth having is where the expectation comes from. The list of
controls is NOT written here -- it is enumerated from the app's own schema dump
(`Settings_dumpSchemaContract`), which reports one row per setting with the
label and value the shell would speak. A setting added tomorrow therefore joins
this gate's requirements the moment it has a schema entry, and stays failing
until something voices it. Keeping the list in the test instead would mean the
gate could only ever catch controls somebody had already thought about.

Three surfaces, because the announcement has to survive all three:

  * the launcher's Settings panel, tabbed from top to bottom, which carries the
    coverage claim -- every visible setting, its name and its current value;
  * each of the other launcher panels, which must announce themselves on
    arrival;
  * the in-game overlay over a running engine session, which draws the same
    rows through the same helper and must speak them there too.

Audio safety: every run sets MDKR_AUDIO=0 and is bounded by an explicit frame
or tick budget. Speech is never routed to a device here; the gate reads text.
