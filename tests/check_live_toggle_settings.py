"""A presentation setting a player can change mid-run must change only the picture.

Video.FrameLimit, Video.MotionSmoothing, Video.AllowTearing and
Camera.Obstruction were SCOPE_RESTART because their receivers latch, and a
setter that wrote them under a running engine was unsafe in both directions.
They are LIVE (the first three) and LEVEL (the camera) now, applied by
video_config.h's deferred-apply mechanism at a declared boundary. This gate is
what makes that claim checkable rather than argued.

THE HAZARD IT EXISTS FOR. gfx_pc_dkr.c's replay holds walk-entry state -- the
saved RDP/RSP registers and, fatally, the saved SEGMENT TABLE -- refreshed by
gfx_start_frame only while present_sched_replay_armed() is true and cleared by
nothing but gfx_dkr_replay_invalidate(). Turn motion smoothing off and the
arming flag goes false while the already-latched subloop keeps running; turn it
back on and the subloop replays against a segment table captured before the
change, whose bases point at freed level memory. The fix is that the apply is
not the setter at all: the boundary applier invalidates the replay history
FIRST, in both directions, so no armed subloop can ever reach a walk entry
captured under the other policy.

The `soak` arm drives that exact sequence -- off/on/off/on across a level load,
many times, at a rate whose subloop is genuinely running -- and the ASan lane
is what turns "no crash" into "no wild read". A stale segment base is a
use-after-free of level memory, which is precisely what ASan reports and what a
release build would happily dereference into a plausible-looking image.

WHAT EVERY ARM ASSERTS.

  no fault      exit 0 and no crash/assert/sanitizer marker.
  it applied    one [SETTINGS-APPLY] row per changed key, naming old and new,
                at the boundary that key's scope declares -- and for the
                presentation domain, a [PRESENT-POLICY] event=live-apply row
                and a re-emitted [PRESENT-MODE] row proving the change reached
                the pacer and the swapchain rather than only the config.
  it is only    the v3 authority, ordered gameplay-event and consumed-input
  the picture   streams are BYTE-IDENTICAL to a run that never toggled. These
                are presentation settings; a state hash that moves means one of
                them is not.
  nothing stale [REPLAY-SUMMARY] staletenants=0 and restorefail=0. The shadow
                registry's stale-identity counter is the nearest published
                observable to the hazard class, and a policy flip that left a
                retired tenant reachable would show up here first.

THE CAMERA ARM ASSERTS THE DEFERRAL ITSELF, in the direction that matters: the
census must still report gate=OBSERVE on every tick between the toggle and the
level load, and gate=MODERN only after. A frame boundary that applied the
camera domain early would be a mid-race cut with no other symptom, and this is
the only thing that would see it.

THE PACE ARM DRIVES THE SETTINGS PANEL'S QUICK CHOICE, not an imitation of
it: `Presentation.Pace=original|smooth` routes through
mdkr_video_config_runtime_set_presentation_pace(), the exact call the radio
button makes. What it owns that no other arm can see is ATOMICITY -- the quick
choice writes Video.FrameLimit and Video.MotionSmoothing in ONE transaction, so
the presentation domain must show two [SETTINGS-APPLY] rows and exactly ONE
re-latch. Two sequential setters would produce two re-latches, and between them
one frame boundary would run with half the change applied.

WHY LAUNCH-RANK VALUES AND NOT THE ENVIRONMENT. The arms need a base policy the
in-game setter is allowed to replace. MDKR_PRESENT_RATE would pin the key at
ENV rank, above RUNTIME, and every toggle would resolve as LOCKED -- a gate
that passes by testing nothing. --video-launch-set is LAUNCHER rank, below
RUNTIME, which is exactly the situation a player is in.

Always muted + headless. Exit 0 = pass.
