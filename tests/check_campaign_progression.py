"""Witness the Adventure campaign's late progression seams, end to end.

Why this exists
---------------
The silver-coins -> boss-rematch -> Wizpig chain is decompiled retail logic that
has always been present and has never been watched. `check_first_boss_progression.py`
closes the campaign up to a world's FIRST boss; `check_bluey2_rematch.py` proves
one rematch race runs and is lost naturally. Everything after that -- collecting
silver coins at all, the flag they write, the world balloons they feed, the
rematch warp they unlock, the Wizpig amulet the rematch awards, and the Wizpig 2
win that selects the true-ending credits -- was ungated.

A single continuous start-to-credits drive would run for hours and would fail as
one opaque blob. This check instead gates each SEAM: a fixture that enters it,
and an assertion on what the game writes leaving it. The fixtures compose, so the
chain of (fixture, seam) pairs is a witnessed campaign. Fixture legitimacy -- how
every bit of fixture N+1 is something seam N is proved to write -- is derived in
tests/fixtures/README.md and re-derived in code by `derive_*` below.

The seams
---------
A  Silver coins persist.       Ancient Lake, entered through the real hub and
                               lobby from the state check_first_boss_progression
                               leaves behind. All eight coins are collected by
                               the game's own coin objects; the flag, the balloon
                               counts and the EEPROM round-trip are asserted, the
                               last of them from a second process.
B  Rematch awards the amulet.  All four worlds' second boss races, won, each one
                               fought on the EEPROM the previous one persisted --
                               so wizpigAmulet climbing 1, 2, 3, 4 is something
                               production wrote four times rather than something
                               a fixture asserted. The negative control is the
                               same race from a save where the FIRST boss was
                               never beaten: production must award the first-boss
                               bit and NO amulet, which is what proves the amulet
                               is gated on the rematch actually being a rematch.
                               A further arm enters the Dino Domain rematch by
                               DRIVING the human through the lobby's own boss
                               door rather than by MDKR_LOAD_TRACK retarget, and
                               asserts the identical post-seam state, so the warp
                               swap obj_loop_exit performs at eight world
                               balloons is witnessed rather than bypassed. The
                               approach is watched by tests/route_plan.py, which
                               reports the waypoint, the closest approach and the
                               reason instead of oscillating to the budget.
C  Four pieces open Wizpig 1.  The carried four-piece save loaded into Timber's
                               Island must redirect to the Wizpig mouth sequence
                               and latch CUTSCENE_WIZPIG_FACE; the same chain one
                               rematch earlier, at three pieces, must not. Then
                               Wizpig 1 itself is raced and won, setting its
                               central-area boss bit.
T  Four championships give     check_trophy_series.py's own championship driver,
   trophies == 0xFF.           imported and chained: four golds, each won on the
                               EEPROM the previous one persisted, so `trophies`
                               climbing 0x3 -> 0xf -> 0x3f -> 0xff is production's
                               arithmetic. It used to be a fixture-E premise.
T.T. Four challenges give      The four challenge courses, won in four separate
   ttAmulet == 4.              processes on one another's saves, shaped exactly
                               like seam B. The negative control replays the
                               FIRST challenge on the save it produced: the piece
                               is gated on the course not already being cleared,
                               so a replay must award nothing and leave ttAmulet
                               at one.
E  Wizpig 2 selects the true   The final boss, won. `menu_credits_init` chooses
   ending.                     between "THE END" (cheat), "THE END?" (legitimate,
                               Wizpig 2 not beaten) and "TO BE CONTINUED ..." +
                               SEQUENCE_CRESCENT_ISLAND (legitimate, Wizpig 2
                               beaten) purely on `gViewingCreditsFromCheat` and
                               `settings->bosses & 0x20`. This arm proves the
                               campaign sets and persists that bit, and then
                               REACHES the screen: the run drives the post-win
                               cutscene stack all the way to MENU_CREDITS and
                               asserts the branch menu_credits_init took. The
                               cheat arm reaches the same screen from a save that
                               was never started and must produce "THE END", so
                               the two endings are distinguished by state this
                               check owns end to end.

What this deliberately does NOT prove
-------------------------------------
See tests/fixtures/README.md, "Residual manual acceptance". The three named
residuals -- the lobby rematch door driven, the trophy/T.T.-amulet chain, and the
credits screen reached from a won Wizpig 2 -- are now seams above rather than
premises. What is still constructed is Future Fun Land's own state: its four
cleared races, its four world balloons and the 47 total the T.T. door counts, the
four world keys, and the world-arrival cutscene flag. Those are the world Wizpig 2
lives in, and this check does not drive to it; the lighthouse unlock that opens
it is gated separately by tests/check_future_fun_land.py. None of the residuals
is weakened into a vacuous assertion in this file.

Every EEPROM image is built in a private temporary directory and deleted. No
ROM-derived data is committed by this check.

      left to run, never signals its end, and the cutscene stack never drains.
      A player cannot reach Wizpig 2 without having arrived in Future Fun Land

    The negative control is the second half of the seam and the reason it means

    award nothing and leave ttAmulet at one. Run at one piece rather than at
