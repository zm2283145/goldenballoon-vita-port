"""A racer must never stay embedded in a collision-meshed object.

Why this exists
---------------
`func_80017A18()` -- the per-facet object-model collision test, and the only
thing that makes a collision-meshed object solid -- is ONE-SIDED by
construction.  It fires only on `sum1 >= -0.1 && sum2 < -0.1`: the point started
outside the facet's plane and ended inside it.  A point that is ALREADY inside
when the tick begins satisfies neither half, so every facet rejects it and the
object stops pushing entirely.  Nothing else ejects it either -- `resolve_collisions()`
only ever sees terrain -- so the point stays inside the mesh for as long as the
object exists.

`resolve_collisions()` (game/src/hasm/collision.c, "Step 2: ensure object is
fully pushed out from underneath") has solved exactly this for terrain since the
ROM.  The object path never had the equivalent, and could not have needed it
before wave "objcoll": until that wave un-stubbed `func_80017A18`, every
collision-meshed object was intangible.  `docs/open-items/collision.md` recorded
the exposure at the time -- *"Wedging is bounded but not impossible: the matched
body's own `counter > 10` bail resets the racer to `x2/y2/z2`"* -- and this is
the pass that closes it, plus the instrument that keeps it closed.

Reported by JappaWakka (goldenballoon #32) as two symptoms: a kart left "45
degrees into the floor unable to move properly" after an angled hit on a locked
balloon door, and a kart stuck inside a palm tree.

What this asserts
-----------------
  1. **MECHANISM, fixed arm** -- with the recovery pass live, a seeded embedded
     point is ejected: `[OBJRECOVER] points >= 1`, and the independent arrival
     probe never reports an embedded tick (`embedded == 0`).
  2. **MECHANISM, control arm (positive control)** -- with `MDKR_OBJCOLL=norecover`
     the SAME seed on the SAME route is NOT ejected: `points == 0` and
     `embedded >= 1`.  This is what makes assertion 1 falsifiable.  The fix's
     failure mode is silence -- a point that is never ejected is simply never
     mentioned again by the one-sided walk -- so the fixed arm's `embedded == 0`
     proves nothing without the control arm's `embedded >= 1` beside it, from the
     same binary, same route, same seed frame.
  3. **ESCAPE** -- the fixed arm must complete its post-impact escape: brake,
     reverse, and drive back out to both return waypoints.  A kart standing
     still with the throttle held into a shut door is CORRECT behaviour, so only
     a commanded escape attempt (the `H`/`R` route steps) can distinguish that
     from a wedge.
  4. **NO FREEZE** -- while a forward waypoint step is steering, no racer may
     hold a bit-exact position for more than `FREEZE_LIMIT` ticks.  Bit-exact is
     the point: `func_80017A18`'s `counter > 10` bail resets a point to its
     ORIGIN, so a pinned kart repeats a position exactly rather than drifting.
     The window deliberately excludes the `H`/`R` steps, which stand still on
     purpose.
  5. **PITCH** -- `[GRND] xrot` must return below `PITCH_LIMIT` within
     `PITCH_WINDOW` ticks of the last `[OBJCOLL]` hit.  This is the direct
     observable for the reporter's first symptom; `func_80054FD0()` levels pitch
     from wheel contact only on ticks where no terrain wall was touched, so a
     kart that never separates never levels.

What this does NOT assert
-------------------------
It does not claim the reported wedge is reproduced.  It is not: four measured
approach angles into the hub's Dino Domain door leaf -- head-on plus three
glancing -- all separated correctly and all escaped when steered away.  The
embedded state is reachable in play (the reporter reached it) but not on a
schedule a gate can assert on, which is why assertions 1-2 seed it.  Assertions
3-5 are the route-driven half and would catch a regression that made the ordinary
case wedge; they are not evidence that the original report is cured.

The seed is a TEST MUTATION and gated as one, behind the versioned capability
`MDKR_INTERNAL_TEST_TOKEN=mdkr64-objcoll-wedge-v1` -- the same pattern
`present_sched.c` uses for its replay arms.  It moves wheel points, which no
production path does.

Usage:
    tests/check_object_wedge.py [--build build] [--rom baserom.us.v80.z64] [-v]

Always runs muted + headless (`MDKR_AUDIO=0` and `--headless-frames`), per
CONTRIBUTING.md's audio-safety rule.
