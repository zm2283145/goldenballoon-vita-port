/*
 * Concurrent SPSC contract for the native sink ring (platform/audio_ring.c).
 *
 * WHY A SECOND RING TEST
 *
 * tests/test_audio_ring.c drives push and pull from one thread, interleaved by
 * hand. That is the right shape for the content and concealment properties: it
 * makes them deterministic. But it cannot see the class of defect the ring
 * exists to avoid, because the whole class requires two threads to be inside
 * the structure at once. A producer that wrote the consumer's index, for
 * instance, passed every sequential case in that file — the sequential harness
 * simply never had a pull in flight for the write to race.
 *
 * So this file runs the real configuration: the game main loop's push on one
 * thread, SDL's audio callback's pull on another, for long enough to wrap the
 * ring many times over, with a forced-overflow phase in the middle. It asserts
 * INVARIANTS rather than exact values, because with two threads running free
 * the exact values are not reproducible and asserting them would either be
 * flaky or secretly single-threaded.
 *
 * The invariant that matters most is the one the overflow redesign turns on:
 *
 *     fill <= capacity, always, as the CONSUMER sees it.
 *
 * The ring's fill is a control input on both sides. If the producer moved
 * `tail` to evict, its write could regress a `tail` the consumer had already
 * advanced from a value it captured earlier, and the next fill the consumer
 * computed would exceed the capacity — it would then read frames that do not
 * exist, from slots the producer is concurrently overwriting. Under the
 * current design the producer only ever advances `head`, so a fill above the
 * capacity is a legitimate, deliberate signal that frames were overwritten,
 * and the consumer resolves it by clamping ITS OWN index and crossfading the
 * skip. This test asserts the consumer never observes a post-clamp fill above
 * the capacity, and that the clamp arms concealment.
 *
 * Run it under a sanitizer to get the rest: ASan/TSan see the index and
 * payload races directly, where the assertions can only see their consequences.
