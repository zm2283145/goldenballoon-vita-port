"""Fail closed unless every release lane makes an explicit Phone Party choice.

`MDKR_PARTY_ORIGIN` is a CMake cache variable compiled INTO the launcher
(CMakeLists.txt). It is a property of the artifact, not of the machine that
runs it, and a build without it shows no Phone Party surface at all
(`PhoneParty_availableInBuild`). For three releases no workflow passed it, so
every packaged Windows/macOS/Linux artifact shipped with the feature silently
absent -- and nothing could see it: the compile succeeded, every unit test
passed, the binary linked the party host, and the only symptom was a feature
that was not there.

That is the defect class this gate exists for: *a release lane silently
omitting a required build parameter*. No compiler, linker, unit test or
runtime assertion can catch it, because the omission is well-formed at every
layer. The only place it is visible is the workflow file itself.

So: every workflow that produces a distributable artifact must

  1. thread `-DMDKR_PARTY_ORIGIN` (or `build_app_bundle.sh --party-origin`)
     into every CMake configure it runs, from a variable rather than a
     literal, bound to the release guard's resolved output; and
  2. carry the guard itself -- refuse to build unless a valid
     `vars.MDKR_PARTY_ORIGIN` is set or `vars.MDKR_ALLOW_PARTYLESS_RELEASE`
     is exactly `1`.

A workflow that packages and uploads but is not registered below is a failure
too: a new release lane must make this decision, not inherit silence.

The workflows are parsed structurally (job blocks, step blocks, run bodies)
rather than with PyYAML: the suite has no third-party Python dependency and
this gate must not be the first, matching tests/check_ci_contract.py's
regex-over-source house style.

Run with --self-test to also prove each assertion can still reject the
regression it names.
