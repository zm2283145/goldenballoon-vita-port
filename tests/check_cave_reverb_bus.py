"""Prove cave sound effects reach the big-room reverb bus (aux bus 1).

Why this exists
---------------
Diddy Kong Racing runs TWO reverb buses (game/src/audio.c):

  * bus 0 = AL_FX_CUSTOM  — the ROM music reverb; every CSP (music) voice stays
    on it, and it is the only bus the port ever built.
  * bus 1 = AL_FX_BIGROOM — the fixed libaudio big-room reverb. Every SFX voice
    is re-parented onto it at note-on (audiosfx.c, func_80065A80), which is what
    gives engine/environment sounds their echo inside caves and tunnels.

The port hardcoded ``maxAuxBusses = 1`` and built only bus 0, so the SFX
re-parent to bus 1 was silently rejected (audio_compat.c) and cave SFX were sent
to the music reverb — or, deep in a cave where the reverb-line strength drives
the dry signal down, effectively muted. That is issue #49: "the echo effect in
Treasure Caves isn't handled correctly; instead of an echo, sounds are simply
turned down, muted around mid cave."

Every other audio gate misses it. ``check_audio_level_reference.py`` drives the
outdoor race_state_oracle route on Ancient Lake, which carries NO reverb lines,
so SFX wet ~= 0 there and the bus SFX land on is irrelevant. The bug only shows
where SFX fxMix > 0 — a reverb-line level. This check is that missing oracle.

What it does
------------
Loads Treasure Caves directly (``MDKR_LOAD_TRACK=30``, the same retarget hook
``check_track_sweep.py`` uses) and drives it with DKR's own AI
(``MDKR_AUTOPILOT=1``) so the racer moves through the cave and under its ceiling,
where ``audspat_calculate_echo`` ramps the SFX reverb send up. The clean-room
synth writes a per-voice reverb-routing line to ``MDKR_AUDIO_VOICE_TRACE_JSONL``
each time a voice's FX mix is set: the aux bus its envmixer is currently a source
of, the wet-send amount (fxMix, 0..127), and how many aux buses the synth built.

What it asserts
---------------
 1. The synth built TWO aux buses (``max_aux == 2`` on every trace line). Before
    the fix this is 1 and this assertion fails first.
 2. Treasure Caves actually loaded as a race and the racer made forward progress,
    so the trace is of a car driving through the cave and not a menu (anti-vacuity
    for "mid-cave").
 3. SFX voices reach the big-room bus WITH wet send: at least ``MIN_BUS1_WET``
    trace lines have ``bus == 1`` and ``fxmix > 0``. Before the fix every
    fxmix>0 line is on ``bus == 0`` (the music reverb) and there are zero bus-1
    lines — RED. After the fix the cave SFX land on bus 1 — GREEN.

Self-validation — this check is proven to be able to fail
---------------------------------------------------------
The pre-fix binary (single aux bus) produces a trace whose every line is
``bus:0 max_aux:1`` including the fxmix>0 cave SFX, so assertions 1 and 3 both
fail. That is the RED state; the fix turns it GREEN. The fxmix lines on this
route are the cave SFX (a CSP voice only emits one if the sequence sends a
reverb control change), and the assertions count wet voices reaching bus 1, so
the discriminator is the SFX routing. This oracle proves the ROUTING — which bus
the cave SFX reach — not that the reverb DSP carries real parameters; the
level/PCM gates cover the DSP itself. (check_music_bus_isolation.py is the
companion oracle proving music voices stay on bus 0.)

Always runs muted + headless (MDKR_AUDIO=0 and --headless-frames), one authored
Original-cadence ticket per host opportunity (MDKR_SYNTH_FIELDS=2), per
tests/README.md.
