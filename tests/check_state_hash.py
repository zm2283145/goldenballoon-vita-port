"""Authoritative-state hash determinism and first presentation-invariance arms.

The fixed-simulation/high-rate-presentation fidelity work rests on one
instrument: a per-tick versioned hash of authoritative state (`[SIMHASH]`
rows). Every later gate — render purity, the
presentation-rate matrix, catch-up equivalence — is "this stream is
identical" between two schedules. This check anchors the instrument:

1. **Determinism:** two identical runs produce byte-identical streams.
2. **Presentation invariance (first slice):** a different window size and the
   other renderer backend must not change one bit of authoritative state.
3. **Positive control:** the `MDKR_RNGSEED=legacy` arm must DIVERGE — the
   hash provably sees the RNG, or the identity assertions above are
   vacuous.
4. **Field-set controls (v3):** each protected state family must independently
   move the hash for exactly one sample, with the archived v1/v2 behavior kept
   executable as a compatibility check.

This gate runs the **v3** field set (`MDKR_STATE_HASH=3`). v3 retains the
v2 object/particle integrator coverage and adds authoritative globals,
progression, racer internals, behavior properties, interactions, model
animation state, and the object fields formerly excluded as render-owned.
The exact contract is documented beside the implementation in
platform/sim_hash.c. v1 and v2 stay selectable for archived comparisons.

Always muted + headless per tests/README.md. Exit 0 = pass.

    # the same binary disagreed with ITSELF, each because an authoritative field
    # was seeded from host memory that moves between processes.
    #
    # Both mechanisms are level-shaped, so a single route cannot see either one:
    #   41 — Smokey 1 has no BHV_SETUP_POINT matching the entrance the route
    #        uses, so track_setup_racers() read the racer's spawn heading out of
    #        an uninitialised stack slot (spawnAngle[], the one member of its
    #        quartet the zeroing loop skipped).
    #   37 — Wizpig 1 is the only level in 0..65 that rains, so it is the only
    #        one that emits PARTICLE_KIND_LINE from WEATHER, and
    #        create_line_particle() is the only particle constructor that left
    #        trans.rotation and angularVelocity holding recycled pool bytes —
    #        host pointer fragments on LP64.
    #   11 — added when the hash was widened to v2. v1 could only see
    #        y_rotation, and the SAME constructor also skips
    #        setup_particle_position/setup_particle_velocity, so `localPos` and
    #        `velocity` were recycled bytes too. Under v2 that failed its own

    #        line particles are emitted by vehicles, not just by rain, so the
    #        blast radius was far wider than 37. Level 11 is kept as the arm
    #        because it diverges earliest (tick 2729) and is not level 37, so
    #        the two arms cannot both go green for the same reason.
    # These are re-run rather than compared to a golden hash on purpose: the
    # assertion is self-consistency, so it stays valid as the simulation
    # legitimately evolves and cannot rot into a stale-constant check.
