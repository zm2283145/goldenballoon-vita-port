"""Presentation rate must not move the authoritative tick (spec 12.2.2).

The presentation scheduler decouples host image opportunities from authoritative
simulation ticks. Production can publish immutable, presentation-only images at
arbitrary rates while the game continues to receive the original fixed tickets.

Arms
----

* **A — fixed-ticket authority.** The promoted ``HostFrameDriver`` clock must
  conserve every two-field ticket on the floor-paced original schedule. Clock
  ticks, issued-plus-pending tickets, completed simulation ticks, state rows,
  and event rows must agree with zero live debt or update-rate violations. The
  authority arm is repeated on WebGPU and compared byte-for-byte with GL.

* **B — rate matrix (slice 2).** The per-tick ``[SIMHASH]`` state stream,
  ordered ``[EVENTHASH]`` gameplay-event stream, consumed input, and temporary
  PCM capture must all be byte-identical
  with ``MDKR_PRESENT_RATE`` unset, ``=30``, and ``=60`` over the same route.
  ``=60`` presents twice per tick, so it is given twice the headless frame
  budget to reach the same 3600 TICKS — authority is counted in ticks, not
  images.

  The unset and ``=60`` endpoints are also run on WebGPU. Both 60 Hz arms use
  the public ``MotionSmoothing=interpolate`` request and must produce real
  intermediate replay walks while preserving every authority stream.

* **C — production mechanism diagnostics.** ``=60`` plus the public
  ``MotionSmoothing=interpolate`` setting alternates a
  completed real endpoint and a production interpolated midpoint. Every
  midpoint must differ from BOTH of its neighbours: same retained display
  list, moved camera. The positive
  control is production ``MDKR_PRESENT_SMOOTHING=off``, whose extra host
  opportunities do not swap or submit a new surface image. Its backend dump
  remains the prior completed authored image.

  A second positive control, ``MDKR_TEST_OBJECT_INTERPOLATION=off``, keeps the
  same interpolated camera but disables generation-keyed matrix rebuilding.
  At least one intermediate frame must then differ from the fully smoothed
  arm, proving the new object path changes backend pixels rather than merely
  incrementing telemetry.

  A third control, ``MDKR_TEST_DEFORMATION_INTERPOLATION=off``, proves the true
  forward-pair path. Enabled replay must consume adjacent ``{T,T+1}`` authored
  vertex streams and visibly differ from an exact-task hold. A semantic observer
  at ``G_VTX`` separately requires byte-identical alpha-zero endpoints.

  A fourth control, ``MDKR_TEST_PARTICLE_INTERPOLATION=off``, runs the battle
  challenge whose continuous point trails change their world-space mesh from
  tick to tick. It requires adjacent retained capture and a visible geometry
  difference against the particle-only hold control.

  A fifth control, ``MDKR_TEST_VERTEX_COLOR_INTERPOLATION=off``, independently
  proves retained shade RGBA is blended only from the same adjacent pair. It
  must visibly differ from the color-hold control without changing authority.

  A sixth control, ``MDKR_TEST_PRIMITIVE_ALPHA_INTERPOLATION=off``, leaves
  geometry and retained vertex RGBA replay enabled while holding draw-local
  primitive alpha at its authored tick. A pixel difference against the normal
  particle arm proves sprite/model/line-particle fades reach the backend
  without double-scaling point trails, whose opacity is already in vertex
  alpha.

  A seventh control, ``MDKR_TEST_EFFECT_INTERPOLATION=off``, forces the authored
  level-3 shield path around each racer in both arms. Shield matrices combine a
  shared render object's local rotation/scale/shear recipe with a generation-
  keyed racer root, so this arm requires both identities to remain collision-
  free and the authoritative stream to remain identical. Compatible forward
  recipes must visibly differ from the authored-matrix hold control.

  An eighth control, ``MDKR_TEST_UV_SCROLL_INTERPOLATION=off``, is the
  midpoint-sensitivity arm for authored UV scroll. It runs Jungle Falls, whose
  waterfall sheet and wave-driven water advance their texture phase every
  authored tick. At an interpolated midpoint the scrolling phase must differ
  from the phase held at BOTH bracketing endpoints, which is exactly what the
  control measures: with the seam off the midpoint reproduces the endpoint
  phase, so a pixel difference between the two arms at ODD present indices is
  the interpolation, and byte-identity at EVEN indices proves the authored
  endpoints did not move. It is non-vacuous by construction — the off arm is
  the pre-M4 renderer's behaviour.

What arm C's pixels are, and are not
------------------------------------

Arm C compares dumped PPM frames, and those come from ``platform_dump_frame``
(platform_sdl_min.c), which reads the BACKEND's captured frame —
``gfx_read_framebuffer_rgb`` / the GL readback of the render target — *before*
the swap. They are not a capture of the swapchain, and nothing in this suite
observes the swapchain at all.

The ship review found that an opportunity with nothing newly drawn used to call
``platform_frame_sync``
and therefore ``SDL_GL_SwapWindow`` on a back buffer whose contents are undefined
after the previous swap. On screen that is flicker at
``FrameLimit=60``/``MotionSmoothing=off``; in this gate it was invisible, because
the backend's captured frame still held the tick's image and arm C's positive
control read exactly that and passed. The engine now skips the swap on the
no-draw paths (``platform_frame_sync_no_swap``), which is what makes the "repeat
the authored image remain visible; arm C keeps working because the dump is
unaffected. The separate ``surfaceupdates`` counter now pins the number of
successful GL swaps/WebGPU surface presents, while these PPMs remain a backend
content oracle rather than an out-of-process display capture.

Arm B history: its first run diverged from tick 1345, at the first level
transition on the route. Two real defects, in order. (1) The deterministic
COUNTER (``osGetCount`` in synthetic pacing) was being advanced once per
PRESENT; its monotonic clamp fabricates a tick whenever it is read without the
clock having moved, so the phase of the advance is observable and not just its
total. (2) The authoritative tick index was bumped BEFORE the interpolated
presents, and since every present pumps input, the last pump before a tick
applied the NEXT tick's scripted input — the simulation consumed every input one
tick early.

Always muted + headless. Exit 0 = pass.
