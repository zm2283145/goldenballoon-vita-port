"""Presentation-rate invariance across CONTENT, not across one route (spec 12.3).

Why this exists, and what it is not
-----------------------------------

``check_presentation_matrix.py`` proves that raising the presentation rate does
not move the authoritative tick -- on ONE level, Ancient Lake, in a car, one
player, NTSC. Spec 12.3 ("Oracle breadth before default promotion") says that
lane is "necessary evidence but not sufficient breadth by itself", and lists
what sufficient looks like: every boss, representative car/hovercraft/plane
races, standard AI races, battle and all challenge types, 1P through 4P, hub and
progression transitions, cutscenes, NTSC and PAL, and a long-running soak.

This gate is that breadth, mechanised against production immutable replay. It
re-uses the matrix gate's authority comparison -- the per-tick ``[SIMHASH]``
stream with ``MDKR_PRESENT_RATE``
unset versus engaged must be BYTE-IDENTICAL -- and runs it over a content set
instead of a single route, via the ``MDKR_LOAD_TRACK=<level>[:<vehicle>]`` hook
that retargets the fixture route's race load.

It also records, per arm, presentation-side quantities that can degrade
without moving a single authoritative bit, and therefore cannot be caught by the
hash comparison at all:

  * the replay walk's matrix RECOMPOSITION REJECT RATIO -- gameplay matrices
    whose (world, view_projection) decomposition did not reproduce the display
    list, which therefore keep the TICK's camera while the rest of the scene
    gets the interpolated one;
  * the RECOMPOSITION TOLERANCE's two populations and the gap between them:
    how many mismatches were accepted as float re-association, how far the
    worst accepted one was, and how far the NEAREST rejected one was. The
    threshold is only principled while those two are orders of magnitude apart,
    so the gap is re-measured every run rather than trusted from the doc;
  * matrix registry FREEZE/RESTORE failures, which silently drop a frame of
    registrations;
  * snapshot capture OVERFLOWS, which drop a whole publish and leave the
    previous pair in place;
  * retained-packet FREEZE FAILURES and ambiguous deformation keys, which
    safely hold animation but expose a capacity or stable-recipe gap;
  * retained point/line particle batches and phase-correct forward pairs. The
    battle-challenge arm is the positive capture witness; changed XYZ/RGBA must
    come from adjacent authored task tokens;
  * INTERPOLATION CONTINUITY -- how many presents found nothing to draw
    (``stale``) and how many actually substituted a camera.

The full 0-65 sweep behind this gate's subset
---------------------------------------------

Levels 0-65 minus 37/41/54 -- 63 levels, every one reaching its race -- were run
once at 5,000 ticks per arm on this branch, and all 63 were byte-identical with
zero overflows and zero freeze/restore failures. Levels 37/41/54 are excluded
because they are the subject of a separate, unrelated defect hunt; measured
here, 37 and 41 are self-consistent (a base-vs-base rerun is byte-identical) and
54 is NOT -- it diverges from itself at tick 2621, its own race load -- so
excluding all three is conservative rather than convenient.

This gate runs a SUBSET of that sweep, chosen for spec 12.3's shape rather than
for coverage arithmetic, because 63 levels x 2 arms is ~45 minutes and the suite
is sequential. Each entry states which 12.3 clause it stands for. The subset
deliberately includes both extremes of the historical pre-tolerance reject
ratio (level 17 at 22.2%, level 21 at 0.012%). The verified geometric tolerance
now accepts the benign re-association population and all 17 current arms report
zero hard rejects; retaining those endpoints makes a tolerance regression
visible against the broadest known numeric spread.

# The reject ratio above used to be 5-22% on race content, and 99.96% of it was

# (DKR_RECOMPOSE_TOLERANCE_LSB = 4096 s15.16 LSBs = 1/16 world unit,
# gfx_pc_dkr.c). The stale-tenant guard and owner-specific replay now leave no
# production hard-reject population at all.
#
# These four bounds are the tolerance's gate, and they are deliberately shaped to

# levels, 6/7/14 on the boss courses -- believed to be "genuine
# mis-associations" from a registration site that composed differently from the
# list it wrote. That attribution was wrong. Every one of those rejects was a
# DEAD TENANT: the registry keys by Mtx pointer, three slot-2 pushers in
# camera.c rebuild a different matrix at an already-registered address without
# registering, and the lookup was answering with the previous tenant's world.
# Measured on level 40, every hard reject reported `bytesmoved=1` -- the bytes
# at the key had changed since registration -- and the worlds being served were
# track-tile geometry on a 960-unit grid at y = -43.
#
# With the stale-tenant guard refusing those, and the vehicle-part pusher

# 17, 20, 21, 26, 38, 40, 46) and `mtxrejectleast` reports -1: there is nothing
# left to reject. So the bound is equality at zero, which is 64x tighter than
# what it replaces, and the control that the old non-zero assertion provided
# now lives in check_tenancy_control() as a deterministic injected mismatch.
# MIN_CONTROL_REJECT_LSB: the POSITIVE CONTROL injects one 2,000,000-LSB
# verification error after disabling the stale-tenant guard. The lower bound is

    Every content arm above asserts ZERO hard rejects. On its own that is a
    weak statement: a tolerance that had grown until it accepted everything
    would satisfy it just as well as a guard that correctly refuses dead
    tenants. The two mechanisms are checked independently here.

    ``MDKR_SHADOW_TENANCY=0`` restores the pre-fix lookup -- serve the first
    tenant's binding without checking that it still describes what is at the
    key -- on the SAME binary, one env var apart. Owner-specific interpolation
    can now supersede those stale worlds before recomposition, so allocator
    reuse is no longer a deterministic rejection injector. The control pairs
    the switch with ``MDKR_TEST_RECOMPOSE_REJECT=1``, which moves one stack-local
    verification element by exactly 2,000,000 LSBs. It therefore proves both
    mechanisms without depending on a stale binding remaining visually live:

      * the production guard still fires on natural dead tenants, and the
        control switch really disables its counter; and
      * the tolerance still rejects a geometric error far above its 4,096-LSB
        acceptance band.

    It also asserts the guard actually FIRES on this content, so a build where
    the tenancy check silently became a no-op fails here rather than passing
    everything.

    Boss content is used because it still produces the in-race dead-tenant burst
    (24 guard refusals on the current level-38 route).
