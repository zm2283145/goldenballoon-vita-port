"""Precipitation must carry a presentation identity, not be replayed verbatim.

THE DEFECT CLASS. A presentation owner is only minted where
``presentation_snapshot_identity_generation(transform)`` succeeds, i.e. for a
real spawned Object in ``gObjPtrList``. Weather is not spawned: snow flakes come
out of ``gSnowVertexData``, the rain sheet out of ``gRainVertices``, and the
splashes out of the module-static ``gRainSplashSegments`` array. None of them
was ever registered, so an interpolated present re-walked their tick-T bytes
unchanged -- the precipitation froze for two to four presents and then jumped
while everything around it glided. Precipitation has the largest per-tick screen
displacement in the scene, so that reads as strobing rather than as falling.

Nothing failed when that was true. There was no gate on this class at all: the
authoritative hashes do not move (nothing about registration is authoritative),
every pixel control passes (a frozen flake is a coherent image), and the
aggregate packet counters were already large from particles and model
deformation. This gate is that missing witness, and it is structural on purpose
-- the counters name the content, where a screenshot difference would only say
that *some* pixel moved.

Three assertions, on two routes:

* **REGISTERED.** ``renderervertexreg`` is nonzero on both routes. This is the
  non-vacuity witness: it says the content was given an identity at all, which
  is the entire defect. Zero here is the pre-fix tree.
* **SUBSTITUTED.** ``renderervertexoverride`` is nonzero. Registration alone
  proves nothing -- a batch can be registered, resolve a pair, and have the two
  endpoints be identical, which substitutes nothing and moves no pixel. An
  override is counted only when {T} and {T+1} actually differ, so this is the
  assertion that the interpolated present shows a DIFFERENT flake position from
  the authored one.
* **GUARDED, AND THE GUARD IS NOT VACUOUS.** ``renderervertexjumphold`` is
  nonzero on the snow route. ``snow_vertices()`` places a flake at
  ``((physics - camera) & radius_mask)``, so a flake leaving the volume
  reappears on the opposite face in the same physics slot: same identity, same
  batch shape, and a jump of the full volume width that a blend would draw as a
  streak across the screen. ``GfxPresentationMatrixOwner::max_vertex_delta``
  refuses those pairs. A zero here would mean either that the wrap never happens
  (it does -- it is how the effect is authored) or that the threshold is so wide
  it can never fire, and both make the guard a comment rather than a check.

  The rain sheet is deliberately NOT asserted to hold: it is an ortho quad
  rotated about a fixed origin and has nothing to wrap.

Determinism is asserted alongside, on the same runs: registering an identity is
a render-side act and must not perturb the authoritative stream. The state hash
of each smoothing arm must equal the same route's hash with smoothing off.

Always muted + headless. Exit 0 = pass.
