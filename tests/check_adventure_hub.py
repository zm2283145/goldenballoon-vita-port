"""P3.5 check: entering ADVENTURE and driving Timber's Island must work.

Why this exists
---------------
Adventure is the mode most players spend their time in, and until P3.5 nothing
had ever driven it.  Getting from FILE SELECT to a controllable kart on the hub
crosses three things no other fixture touches, and each one was broken:

  1. `set_current_text()` overlays `GameTextTableStruct.entries[]` directly on
     ASSET_GAME_TEXT_TABLE bytes.  Those entries are 32-bit ROM words, but the
     decomp declares them `char *` — 8 bytes on LP64.  The stride was therefore
     doubled, `size` came out as garbage (measured 65536), and the follow-up
     `asset_load(ASSET_GAME_TEXT, ...)` DMA'd 64 KB over live arena objects.  The
     first *symptom* was a SIGSEGV in `free_3d_model()` while tearing the intro
     cutscene down, ~600 frames after the corrupting write.  Reached by ordinary
     play twice over: the intro cutscene's dialogue, and every hub door's
     balloon-requirement textbox (`obj_loop_door`).
  2. `ParticleBehaviour` ends in a pointer, so `sizeof` grew 0xA0 -> 0xA8 and
     `colourLoop` moved 0x9C -> 0xA0 while the on-disk record stride stayed 0xA0.
     Every colour-looping emitter read the next record's floats as a pointer:
     crash in `create_general_particle()` ~1280 frames into the hub.
  3. `func_80026E54()` (void/skybox segment sorting) writes TWO entries per
     segment into an array declared for one, so with the nine void segments the
     hub can put in view at once it overran `sp94[10]` by eight elements and
     aborted in `__stack_chk_fail`.

All three are silent-until-fatal and none is reachable from any pre-P3.5
fixture, so this check exists to keep the route covered.

What this asserts
-----------------
  1. **The route arrives.**  The menu trace must show GAME_SELECT(19) ->
     FILE_SELECT(6) -> MENU_NEWGAME_CINEMATIC(23), the cutscene level must load
     (levelId 36, cutsceneId 15) *and must be left again*, and
     ASSET_LEVEL_CENTRALAREAHUB (levelId 0) must load.  Asserting the cutscene is
     left matters: bug 1 above showed up exactly at that teardown.
  2. **There is a real, controllable racer for >= 1000 frames.**  [PACE] racer
     rows after the hub load, positions all finite, y inside a generous band, no
     single-frame teleport, and the race clock advancing.
  3. **It actually drives.**  Total path length and the bounding box of the
     visited positions must both be large, and the closed-loop tour must actually
     REACH its named waypoints — position alone cannot tell driving from
     vibrating against a wall, and a waypoint on the far side of some terrain is
     a stronger statement than a spline counter (see HUB_TOUR_ROUTE).
  4. **The scene still draws.**  Sampled frames must contain a real rendered
     scene (distinct 5-bit colours + luma sigma over a centre crop), reusing
     check_race_drive.py's metric and thresholds.  One sample is allowed to fail:
     the route brushes a hub door, whose fade briefly whites the screen out (a
     ~30-frame dip measured at 209 colours / sigma 7.9 around frame 6600), and
     that is DKR's own transition, not a render fault.
  5. **The process exits 0.**  Two of the three bugs above aborted with nothing
     at all on stderr, exactly like the `timetrial_ghost_read` overflow that an
     earlier version of check_race_finish_time.py silently passed.

Usage:
    tests/check_adventure_hub.py [--build build] [--rom baserom.us.v80.z64]
                                 [--keep-frames DIR] [-v]

Always runs muted + headless (MDKR_AUDIO=0 and --headless-frames), per
tests/README.md.  Exit 0 = pass; exit 1 = at least one assertion failed (each
printed with the measured value).

# CLOSED-LOOP HUB TOUR ("closedloop" wave).
#
# The script's own driving inputs -- throttle held from frame 6000, stick RIGHT
# for a few frames every 200 -- are a blind open-loop route, and they stopped
# working the moment the ROM's RNG seed / arctan table / table-based trig became
# the defaults: the drifted line put the kart inside a hub EXIT's activation
# radius, so instead of touring Timber's Island it entered the Dino Domain lobby
# at frame 6883 and then boss level 38 at 7336. Every in-hub assertion below then
# failed for a reason that has nothing to do with the hub -- cp 2, lap 0, and a
# 4367-unit "teleport" that was really the level change.
#
# These 44 waypoints are SAMPLED FROM THAT SAME ROUTE'S OWN [PACE] TRACE, one
# every 1000 world units of arc, so the tour covers the ground the open-loop
# fixture is documented to cover -- including the stretch that puts nine void
# segments in view at once and caught func_80026E54's sp94[10] overrun. What
# changes is only that the kart now STEERS AT each point
# (platform/mdkr_adventure.c) instead of hoping a fixed pulse train still lands
# there.
#
# SPACING IS LOAD-BEARING, and two runs were spent learning it. The hook drives
# straight at the next waypoint, so the CHORD between two of them has to be
# drivable, not just the sampled positions:
#   - 4500-unit spacing (9 points): a chord passed 158 units from Taj
#     (BHV_PARK_WARDEN at (-197, 255, 193)), whose dialogue opens on contact
#     within 300 units and then calls disable_racer_input() every frame. The kart
#     travelled 224 units in 6133 frames.
#   - 2200-unit spacing (20 points): the chord (-1180, 691) -> (890, 921) cuts
#     across the island's middle and the kart wedged at (79, 243, 766) with
#     velocity 0 for 5000 frames.
# At 1000 the polyline hugs the traced line. The first leg is hand-placed at
# (200, 500) -- the same north-east opening check_adventure_race_loop.py has
# always used -- because the sampled points start 1000 units along and a straight
# line from the spawn to the first of them would run over Taj.
#
# Once the tour is exhausted the hook hands the kart back and MDKR_AUTOPILOT
# drives the tail: the hub's AI-node graph is a closed loop on the central beach,
# so the tail can lap for ever but can never turn in at a door.
