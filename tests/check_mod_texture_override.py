"""A pack's textures replace the ROM's, and the settings switch applies while you play.

Why this exists
---------------
`Content.PacksEnabled` is declared `MDKR_VIDEO_SCOPE_LIVE`, which is a promise
to the player: tick the "Custom content" box and the picture changes, no
relaunch. For a long time nothing kept that promise. The key was read exactly
once, by `platform_content_packs_init()` at boot, and no publisher ever carried
it anywhere afterwards -- so the settings checkbox took effect on the NEXT
launch while `Tab`, which pulls the identical lever
(`mdkr_mod_texture_set_enabled`), changed the picture instantly. Two controls,
one lever, two different answers, and the slow one was the one that looked
authoritative.

`mdkr_video_config_publish()` now carries the key to that lever, and this gate
is what makes the promise checkable rather than argued. It is also the only
thing standing between a future refactor and a checkbox that silently does
nothing again, which is a defect no crash, no log line and no unit test would
ever surface.

WHY BOTH DIRECTIONS ARE LIVE, WHICH WAS NOT OBVIOUS. If the pack scan were
skipped when the setting starts at 0, off->on would have nothing to switch on
and would have had to stay restart-required. It is not skipped:
`platform_content_packs_init()` scans `mods/`, applies `Content.PackDisabled`,
and binds the decoded-texture store unconditionally -- the setting only decides
whether the store ANSWERS. Arm 3 below is the observation that proves it, not
an inference from reading the source.

WHAT THIS CANNOT DRIVE, STATED PLAINLY. `Tab` is an SDL keyboard event, and a
headless run has no keyboard; the input-script fixture format carries
controller tokens only. So there is no `Tab` arm here. Tab and the setting call
the same one-line lever, and the rule between them -- an explicit settings
change wins and sets the lever to whatever the setting says, ending any
momentary comparison -- is a property of the publication point, documented
there and asserted by the ROM-free `video_config_runtime` unit test in both
directions. What is NOT claimed anywhere is that this file tests the keypress.

The route
---------
Boot with no input script, 380 frames, 320x240, GL. Textures first bind at
frame 9 and the title screen's set at frame 90, so the whole measurement sits
inside the cheapest part of the game to reach. Four runs:

    corpus     no pack, MDKR_MOD_TEXTURE_DUMP -- writes <digest>.png for every
               texture the route binds. This is the pack author's own workflow
               (tools/mod_texture_dump.py, docs/MODDING.md) and the pack below
               is built from its output, so the digest contract is exercised
               end to end rather than pinned to a constant that could rot.
    baseline   no pack at all
    pack       every dumped digest overridden with solid magenta
    live       the same pack, plus two runtime settings changes

Nothing ROM-derived is written into the repository: every run has its own
throwaway working directory, which is also where `mods/` and the dumped corpus
live.

The pack overrides EVERY digest the corpus run found, with one 256x256
quadrant PNG this file encodes itself: a magenta top-left quarter on green.
Overriding everything rather than one hand-picked texture is what lets the
frames below be compared as whole-image hashes: the question "did any pack
pixel survive" then has a yes/no answer at every frame, instead of depending
on whether one chosen texture happened to be on screen. The size and the two
colours are both deliberate. The replacement is LARGER than every logical
tile the route binds, which is the direction real upscale packs take and the
direction where broken addressing shows a corner instead of wrapping (issue
#34); and a two-colour image is what makes addressing witnessable at all --
this gate's earlier solid-magenta form could not tell "the whole image" from
"any corner of it", which is exactly how the defect shipped past it.

The live arm's schedule, and why the frames are where they are
--------------------------------------------------------------
    MDKR_TEST_SETTINGS_TOGGLE=Content.PacksEnabled=0@150,Content.PacksEnabled=1@320

That is the existing headless seam for the live-settings path
(platform_sdl_min.c), and it fires `mdkr_video_config_runtime_set()` -- the
exact call the settings panel makes. Not a rewritten ini and a relaunch, which
would prove only that the boot path still reads the file.

Frames are sampled at 120, 240 and 360 (MDKR_DUMP_FROM=120, MDKR_DUMP_EVERY=120)
-- one in each of the three states, each at least 30 frames clear of a
transition. Measured on the reference run (US v80), the change lands on the
frame the toggle names, with no smearing in either direction: frames 91..149
carry pack pixels, 150..319 are byte-identical to the no-pack baseline, and
320 onward carry pack pixels again.

What is asserted
----------------
 1. REACHABILITY, AND NOTHING VACUOUS. Every run exits 0 with no runtime
    diagnostic; the corpus run dumps textures; the pack and live runs report
    the pack active and the baseline run reports no pack at all; both scheduled
    settings changes are logged as applied (a key pinned by the environment
    would resolve LOCKED here and every assertion below would be measuring
    nothing).

 2. A PACK CHANGES THE PICTURE. At all three sampled frames the pack run's
    image differs from the baseline's. This is what makes assertion 3 mean
    something: "identical to the baseline" is only evidence if the pack arm
    is not.

 3. THE SETTINGS CHANGE APPLIES LIVE, AND OFF MEANS THE ROM'S OWN TEXELS.
    Frame 120, before the first change, is byte-identical to the pack run.
    Frame 240, after Content.PacksEnabled=0 was set THROUGH THE SETTINGS
    ROUTE, is byte-identical to the NO-PACK BASELINE.

    Byte-identical is the whole assertion. A merely "different" frame would
    also be produced by a store that stopped answering while the texture cache
    kept serving the pack pixels it had already uploaded; only an exact match
    with the baseline proves the cache retired those entries and re-uploaded
    the ROM's texels, which is what `override_generation` exists to do.

 4. AND IT COMES BACK. Frame 360, after Content.PacksEnabled=1 was set at
    runtime, is byte-identical to the pack run again -- so the registry really
    was scanned despite the switch having been off, and the flip costs a cache
    generation rather than a rescan. This is the arm that would have had to
    become "the panel says restart-required" had the scan been conditional.

 5. IT IS PRESENTATION ONLY. The `[SIMHASH]` v3 stream is byte-identical across
    all three arms, all 380 rows. Content.PacksEnabled is content class
    (`mdkr_video_key_is_content`, folded into `mdkr_video_key_is_player_comfort`)
    and toggling it mid-run must not move one bit of authoritative state.

Self-validation -- this check is proven to be able to fail
-----------------------------------------------------------
POSITIVE CONTROL (run by hand, not by this file): comment out the two receiver
calls in `mdkr_video_config_publish()` (platform/video_config_runtime.c), which
restores the exact defect this gate exists for -- the key is still declared
LIVE, the setter still returns LIVE, the log still says applied=1, and nothing
happens. Rebuild and re-run. The check exits 1 at assertion 3:

    check_mod_texture_override: FAIL - frame 240: Content.PacksEnabled=0 was
    applied at runtime, but the frame is not the no-pack baseline (live
    <hash> vs baseline <hash>); it is still the pack's image

Assertion 4 fails on the same build for the mirrored reason. Assertions 1, 2
and 5 keep passing, honestly: the pack is still installed and still applied, and
a setting that does nothing moves no state either.

Always muted + headless (`MDKR_AUDIO=0` and `--headless-frames`), per
tests/README.md. `MDKR_AUDIO=off` would be a silent no-op -- only the digit `0`
disables. Exit 0 = pass.
