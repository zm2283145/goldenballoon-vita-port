/*
 * Firewall-negative observation, native half.
 *
 * A firewall does not produce a tidy protocol error. It refuses the socket, or
 * lets the TCP connect through and then kills the WSS upgrade, or drops an
 * established connection with no close frame. This gate drives
 * MdkrNativePartyHost with a transport that fails each of those ways and
 * asserts the documented fail-neutral contract:
 *
 *   - no crash and no hang: every path is bounded, service() drains at most
 *     its per-call event bound and the host never retries on its own,
 *   - the seat and local play are unaffected: no pad binding is created by a
 *     refused open, and the other three ports are never touched,
 *   - the pad goes neutral rather than stale: after a drop, custody is
 *     released or input is refused, and no packet from the dead epoch reaches
 *     the engine,
 *   - the user-visible message is the documented one, verbatim.
