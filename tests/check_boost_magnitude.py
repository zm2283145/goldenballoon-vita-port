"""check_boost_magnitude — the zip-pad boost is the magnitude DKR authored, and
it does not depend on how many racers are in the race.

    python3 tests/check_boost_magnitude.py [-v] [--build DIR] [--rom ROM]

Always muted + headless (MDKR_AUDIO=0 and --headless-frames), per tests/README.md.
Exit 0 = pass; exit 1 = at least one assertion failed (each printed with the
measured value).

WHAT THIS CLOSES (register: docs/open-items/gameplay.md, wave "zippad").
An eight-racer Tracks race was once measured at 44.9 world-units/frame off a zip
pad against 23.2 for "the same pad" in a solo Time Trial — 3.2x vs 1.67x top
speed — and the asymmetry was recorded as unverified rather than assumed correct.
This check is the closing measurement.

WHY IT ARMS THE BOOST INSTEAD OF DRIVING OVER A PAD.  The 44.9 figure came from a
pad that `nav_to_time_trial_race.txt` + `MDKR_AUTOPILOT` *happened* to drive over
in 2026-07.  It does not any more: the AI line moved when the wave "closedloop"
ROM-fidelity corrections landed, and the route now never touches SURFACE_ZIP_PAD
at all (measured: 0 frames of surface 3 over the whole race, and
`check_race_drive.py` reports max step 14.3 where it used to report 44.9).  That
is precisely the fixture class tests/README.md warns about — the racing *line* is
chaotic with respect to any simulation change — so no committed route can be
relied on to keep crossing one particular pad, and a check calibrated on one
would be measuring the AI, not the boost.

So `MDKR_ZIPPAD_BOOST=<frame>[:<ticks>]` (game/src/objects.c) arms the human
racer in exactly the state `racer.c:5727` arms it in for `SURFACE_ZIP_PAD` on a
car — `boostTimer = normalise_time(45)`, `boostType = BOOST_LARGE` — once, at a
fixed frame.  Everything downstream is untouched decomp code: all 310
boost/velocity statements in `game/src/racer.c` are byte-identical to the decomp
baseline in `.decomp-baseline`, so what is measured here IS the shipping boost,
with a deterministic trigger substituted for a chaotic one.

THE BROKEN DIRECTION (a check that cannot fail is not a check).  The `<ticks>`
field is the perturbed boost constant.  Two control arms run every time:

  * `:120` — holds the boost 2.7x as long. It reaches essentially the same peak,
    but the exact timer trace and post-45-tick tail reject it.
  * `:15`  — a third of the authored constant. The exact timer trace rejects it
    even if a favourable piece of road happens to preserve a similar peak.

Both must FAIL the baseline assertions.  If either one passes, this check fails
with POSITIVE CONTROL BROKEN, because that means the assertions below no longer
constrain the boost constant at all.

MEASURED (2026-08-03, arming frame 4000, cadence enhanced / 1 field, Ancient Lake,
default car, `MDKR_AUTOPILOT`; every number reproduced run to run):

  arm                       cruise   boost frames   peak |velocity|   peak/cruise
  8-racer Tracks            12.542        45           22.241            1.97x
  solo Time Trial           12.769        45           22.323            1.95x
  control :15               12.571        15           21.667            1.90x
  control :120              12.494       120           22.361            1.98x

The eight-racer and the solo Time Trial peaks differ by 0.082 velocity units —
0.37% — with the boost armed identically.  There is no racer-count coupling in
the mechanism, and `normalise_time()` (objects.c:1341) has no framerate term
either: it is a PAL 5/6 rescale of the constant and nothing else.

The `:120` row is the physically interesting one and is why peak velocity alone
is not enough: a 2.7x longer boost reaches nearly the same peak. The authoritative
evidence for the constant is the consecutive 45..1 timer sequence followed by
zero, with BOOST_LARGE retained throughout. Velocity still proves the magnitude
and racer-count independence, but it is not required to be monotonic: steering,
road gradient, walls, and AI braking remain live downstream of the boost.

VERDICT RECORDED: authored, not a port defect.  The historical 44.9-vs-23.2 pair
was never a controlled comparison — two different racing lines, at two different
points of two different tracks-modes, with two different entry speeds — and
neither figure is reproducible on current source.
