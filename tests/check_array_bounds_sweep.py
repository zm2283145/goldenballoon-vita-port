"""No NEW out-of-bounds array index -- and no new instance of three bug SHAPES
that no runtime instrument in this tree can see -- may appear in game/src.

Three phases, and the second and third exist because the first cannot see them:

  1. RUNTIME. Build with UBSan array-bounds + pointer-overflow + shift-exponent,
     drive 8 routes, fail on any report not in ALLOWED.
  2. STATIC (tools/sweep_bug_shapes.py). Enumerate three shapes UBSan is blind
     to, and fail on any TRIAGE-severity finding without a reason in
     SHAPE_TRIAGE, or on any growth in the informational population.
  3. CONTROLS. The bounds phase 2 is about are UNREACHED in normal play --
     minimum measured slack 4, 24, 4, 56, 291 slots, and 84 of 500 candidates --
     so phases 1 and 2 alone would pass on a build with every bound deleted.
     Phase 3 forces each boundary from the same binary, requires the guarded and
     unguarded arms to differ, and separately checks that every bound really is
     the caller's own capacity (a bound can be passed WRONG with no symptom).

Why this check exists
---------------------
The worst bug class this port has hit is *the decomp splits one ROM array into two
adjacent C objects, and the code indexes across the boundary*. It is invisible on
the host we develop on, because whether the two objects end up adjacent is a
linker decision and the two linkers disagree: measured on this tree, **432 of the
1001 data pairs that have the same neighbour on both targets sit at a different
distance** on LP64 Mach-O than on wasm32. So "it works natively" carries no
information at all, and a native crash-free suite carries none either — the wave
table (docs/OPEN_ITEMS.md "wavetable") crashed two real players in the browser
while every native fixture passed.

The one instrument that saw it *without a crash, on the host, before it shipped*
was UBSan `-fsanitize=array-bounds`. It had been reporting
`waves.c:535 index 2 out of bounds for 'unk8012A5E8[2]'` all along and nobody was
looking. This check is "somebody is looking": it builds an instrumented binary,
drives the fixtures, and fails on any out-of-bounds index that is not already
triaged in ALLOWED below.

It catches the *cause* (an index leaving its array) rather than one symptom, so it
generalises to the whole class, on any future toolchain — which is what
tests/check_wave_visible_table.py cannot do, since that one pattern-matches the
codegen of a single table.

What is allow-listed, and why that is not a whitewash
----------------------------------------------------
Every entry below is a decomp idiom that was measured and found harmless: a
*flattened 2-D index* (`arr[0][i]` walking past the inner array but staying inside
the same object), or the documented LP64 `s32`-as-a-pointer idiom. Each has to
name what it is. Anything else is a finding.

Entries are keyed on (file, type, source snippet), NOT on a line number, so that
editing a file does not spuriously re-baseline the whole list. Move the code and
the entry still matches; *change* the offending line and it does not, which is
exactly when a human should look again.

Fails closed
------------
"No reports" cannot distinguish a clean build from a build that is not measuring:

  * the instrumented binary must actually import `__ubsan_handle_out_of_bounds`
    (i.e. the sanitizer flag survived the CMake flag ordering — note that
    `-Wno-everything` in CMakeLists.txt is applied *after* CMAKE_C_FLAGS, which is
    why the sweep flags go through -DMDKR_EXTRA_C_FLAGS);
  * every run must exit 0;
  * REQUIRED_SENTINELS must all still be reported. They are allow-listed idioms on
    paths every route crosses, so if they go quiet the instrument is broken, not
    the game.

Verified in both directions, on real builds

The allow-list survived the reported lines moving 7378 -> 7383 and 2994 -> 3001
between two runs of this sweep, which is the snippet key doing its job.

MUTED + HEADLESS: every run passes --headless-frames (which returns before the SDL
audio device is opened) and MDKR_AUDIO=0.

    # 45 -> 48, RE-MEASURED 2026-08-14 on the first full-suite traversal in
    # the project's history (tools/sweep_bug_shapes.py; the qualification
    # pass that finally reached task 187). The growth is the multiplayer-
    # foundation campaign (ba28eae): rollback_engine_registry.c contributes
    # two registry-full `count ==` saturation guards over fixed-size span
    # tables, and one further site rides the campaign's growth of the
    # objects.c/menu.c populations. Measured, not summed, per the 2026-08-09
    # merge-hazard note below.
    "equality-cap": 48,
    # +116 from platform/. Overwhelmingly `1u << port` / `1u << slot` bit masks
    # over small fixed domains and `value >> (i * 8)` byte extractions -- the
    # var-count flavour the enumerator reports without an added constant. The
    # ceiling's job is to fail on GROWTH, so it is set to the measured
    # population, not padded.
    #
    # 257 -> 262. Five entries were added since the ceiling was measured at
    # aaf7486; each was read and each is bounded by construction, so the
    # population grew without the class changing:
    #   * object_functions.c obj_loop_door / obj_loop_scenery -- both shift
    #     through DKR_SHL32, which is the port's masking idiom and exists
    #     precisely to make a wide count defined.
    #   * gfx_pc_dkr.c dkr_check_alpha_compare (x2) and dkr_textlut_fmt -- the
    #     count is the G_MDSFT_* #define, a compile-time constant; the
    #     enumerator reports var-count for anything that is not a numeric
    #     literal in the expression.
    #   * gfx_pc_dkr.c dkr_dp_load_tile (x2) -- `shift` is assigned 0, 1 or 2
    #     by a switch over G_IM_SIZ_* immediately above the use.
    #   * presentation_snapshot.c camera-cut journal (x2) -- `1u << camera_id`
    #     into a uint32_t, guarded at both sites by
    #     `camera_id < PRESENTATION_SNAPSHOT_MAX_CAMERAS` (8).
    # (Nine appear as additions against aaf7486; four older entries moved or
    # were rewritten, so the net is five.)
    #
    # 262 -> 265. Three sites from the presentation work, each read and each
    # bounded by an explicit guard rather than by convention:
    #   * gfx_pc_dkr.c dkr_capture_uv_scroll_endpoints -- `moved |= 1u << i`
    #     over `i < num_tris`, and the function returns early unless
    #     `num_tris <= GFX_PRESENTATION_UV_SCROLL_MAX_TRIANGLES` (16). The
    #     accumulator is a uint16_t, so the domain and the type match exactly.
    #   * presentation_snapshot.c presentation_snapshot_capture_camera (x2) --
    #     `1u << viewport` where `viewport = write->camera_count` immediately
    #     after `if (write->camera_count >= PRESENTATION_SNAPSHOT_MAX_VIEWPORTS)
    #     return`.
    #   * presentation_snapshot.c presentation_snapshot_capture_commit -- the
    #     unconsumed-note sweep shifts by a loop index bounded by
    #     `write->camera_count`, which the guard above caps; the sibling
    #     `1ull << entry->camera_id` is fenced by an explicit
    #     `camera_id >= 0 && camera_id < PRESENTATION_SNAPSHOT_MAX_CAMERAS`.
    #
    # 2026-08-09: raised 257 -> 261, and the four are NOT one batch of work.
    # Measured on origin/main at 080c4c4 the population is already 260 -- three
    # above the recorded ceiling -- so this gate was failing on main before the
    # content-pack work began, and had been for some time. It went unnoticed
    # because array_bounds_sweep is a `rom`-role check: hosted CI cannot run it
    # (no ROM on a runner), so only a local full-suite run sees it, and a subset
    # run does not. That is the same shape as the last gate this project lost
    # track of. The three are not identified here because identifying them means
    # bisecting the class population across the commits since the ceiling was
    # last set, which is worth doing and is not this change.
    #
    # The fourth is from this work and is named: platform/mod_texture_key.c:46,
    # `bytes[index] = (uint8_t) ((value >> (index * 8)) & 0xffu)` -- the
    # little-endian field encoder in the published texture digest. index runs
    # 0..3 over a 4-byte local, so the shift count is 0, 8, 16 or 24 and the
    # value is a u32; it cannot reach the width.
    #
    # MERGE HAZARD, recorded 2026-08-09. The release line (`land/rc2`) moved
    # these same two constants independently and by different amounts:
    # equality-cap 39 -> 45 and shift-count 262 -> 265 there, for
    # gfx_font_outline.c's solve_face_fit counters and three presentation shift
    # sites. Both branches therefore touch these lines and will conflict
    # textually.
    #
    # RESOLVING IT BY SUMMING THE NUMBERS IS WRONG. The tool reports the
    # informational population *after* excluding the enumerated TRIAGE entries,
    # and the two branches enumerate different sites -- so the combined ceiling
    # is not 261 + (265 - 262), and it is not the larger of the two either. Take
    # both triage blocks (that part is genuinely additive), then RE-MEASURE the
    # combined population on the merged tree and set each ceiling to what the
    # tool actually reports. The ceiling is a measured population, never a
    # proof, and a summed guess would silently re-open exactly the growth this
    # gate exists to catch.
    # 2026-08-10, merge of land/rc2 and worktree-hm-parity-sprints: both
    # narratives above are true of their own branches. Per the merge-hazard
    # note the ceilings were RE-MEASURED on the merged tree with
    # tools/sweep_bug_shapes.py -- not summed, not maxed. shift-count came
    # back 266: the release line's 265 plus exactly one site, and it is the
    # one parity's narrative names and reads (mod_texture_key.c:46, the
    # little-endian digest encoder, index 0..3 over a u32). equality-cap
    # came back 45, coincidentally equal to the release line's number.
    #
    # 266 -> 269. Three sites from the standing finish/spectator-camera
    # exclusion, each read and bounded before the shift:
    #   * presentation_snapshot_set_camera_excluded (x2) returns unless
    #     viewport_index is in [0, PRESENTATION_SNAPSHOT_MAX_VIEWPORTS), then
    #     uses that checked value for the set/clear bit.
    #   * presentation_snapshot_capture_camera reads the exclusion bit using
    #     viewport = write->camera_count immediately after the existing
    #     camera_count >= PRESENTATION_SNAPSHOT_MAX_VIEWPORTS failure guard.
    # These are the same four-viewport domain as the neighboring camera-cut
    # journal sites documented above; none can approach the 32-bit width.
    #
    # 269 -> 367, RE-MEASURED 2026-08-14 on the first full-suite traversal
    # (task 187 had never executed on any machine before this pass). The +98
    # is the online/session campaign's arrival in the sweep's field of view:
    # match_preflight.c (22), match_transport.c (10), party_protocol.c (10),
    # session_bridge.c (9), match_manifest.c, match_signal, sha256.c and the
    # rollback registry -- overwhelmingly `1u << slot` masks over the
    # four-slot roster domain and `value >> (i * 8u)` byte extraction in the
    # wire encoders, the same var-count flavour the +116 note above already
    # describes for platform/. The remainder is campaign growth inside
    # already-counted files (gfx_pc_dkr.c effect-recipe paths, menu.c,
    # object_functions.c). Ceiling set to the measured population, not a
    # guess, per the standing rule.
    #
    # 367 -> 368, 2026-08-25 (release-1.5.2, issue #52). One new var-count
    # shift, in platform/fast3d/gfx_pc_dkr.c: the inverted-rectangle
    # span-invalid rule (dkr_dp_fill_rectangle / dkr_dp_texture_rectangle)
    # reads the cycle type via `rdp.other_mode_h & (3U << G_MDSFT_CYCLETYPE)`
    # to gate the fixed-point FILL/COPY `+1 << 2` coordinate adjustment before
    # deciding whether an inverted rect draws. G_MDSFT_CYCLETYPE == 20
    # (game/include/PR/gbi.h), so it is a compile-time-constant `3U << 20`
    # into a u32 -- flagged var-count only because the count is a macro, not a
    # numeric literal, and covered at runtime by -fsanitize=shift-exponent.
