"""Hold both shield and magnet effect shells inside the interpolation envelope.

An interpolated present is a reconstruction of an image between two authored
ones. Whatever else that reconstruction is free to do, it is not free to put an
object somewhere neither authored image ever put it: a present at alpha in
(0, 1) lies *between* its endpoints, so an object's displacement from its own
tick's authored pose can never exceed the displacement that tick's two authored
poses have from each other. That is the whole content of this gate, and it is
the condition ``docs/evidence/smoothing-artifact-repro-2026-08.md`` §2.6 calls
(a) -- the load-bearing one.

Why a pixel gate exists at all when the same defect has an exact structural
witness (``ownertickcheck``/``ownertickmismatch``, asserted in
``check_smoothing_stage_bisection.py``): the structural witness knows the shape
of the defect that was found. This one does not. It measures where the shell
actually lands on screen, so a future stage that gets its endpoint pairing
wrong in some *different* way -- a stale recipe, a mis-scaled shear, a
substituted racer -- still trips it.

What the diagnosis note establishes, and why the thresholds below are not
tuned: on this route the shell's displacement from its own tick's authored pose
was **50.79 / 51.08 / 50.82 px** at alpha 1/4, 2/4, 3/4 against an
endpoint-to-endpoint envelope of **5.25 px mean, 18.42 px max** over the same
29 authored pairs. The failure margin is 9.7x on the mean and 2.8x against the
single worst authored tick in the window. No tolerance choice adjudicates that.

Two conditions, and a deliberate asymmetry between them:

* **(a) envelope-bound.** Every interpolated present's displacement is at most
  the window's worst authored step, plus a small segmentation tolerance. This
  is a hard failure. It also rejects the *held-matrix* arm (C6 in the note:
  24.53 px at alpha 3/4 over an 18.42 px bound), which is correct and
  deliberate -- disabling the effect stage is not a fix, and a gate that only
  rejected the shipped defect would go green the day someone "fixed" it that
  way.
* **(b) converge-to-zero at alpha -> 0.** The alpha-zero contract is byte-exact
  reproduction of the authored endpoint, so displacement must *start* small and
  grow. A constant offset is the only way to fail this while passing every
  endpoint check, which is what names the shipped defect rather than merely
  detecting it. But (b) is only meaningful when there is a ramp to measure: a
  correctly anchored shell under a chase camera is near-flat AND near-zero, and
  ordering near-zero noise would be a coin flip. So (b) is evaluated only when
  the alpha-3/4 mean clears the envelope mean -- i.e. exactly when the
  displacement is large enough for its shape to mean something -- and is
  reported as ``not-discriminating`` otherwise. That is not an escape hatch:
  when (b) does not apply, (a) has already passed with room to spare, which is
  the same statement.

Two production arms, one shield and one magnet, because they share the replay
code but not the rendered geometry. The contrast arms that made the diagnosis
readable (effect-off, all-off, 60 Hz) are in the note; re-running those for each
effect would re-derive a number that is not the pass criterion.

Always muted + headless. Exit 0 = pass.
