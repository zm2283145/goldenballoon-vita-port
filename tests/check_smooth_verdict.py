"""Prove the [SMOOTH-VERDICT] per-surface-class census is real, not vacuous.

Task 2 of the presentation-safety plan adds a census that translates existing
replay clause outcomes (uv_scroll_hold_*, MDKR_REPLAY_HOLD_*) into one
[SMOOTH-VERDICT] row per graded MdkrSurfaceClass. This gate proves three
things about that translation on one Remastered scripted race:

* it actually fires: at least one row for WATER_WAVE, OBJECT_ROOT and
  WORLD_SCROLL;
* it is not vacuous: every row's blend+snap equals its own total, and
  WATER_WAVE graded at least one draw;
* it pins the wave surfaces' ownership. Task 7 gave wave geometry a real
  presentation owner (``game/src/waves.c``: one registered transform per
  visible tile, topology-keyed on the grid LOD variant), so WATER_WAVE must
  now BLEND at least once and must file NO_OWNER exactly zero times -- a
  minority of unowned wave draws would hide behind ``top_reason`` otherwise.
  ``--no-expect-water-owned`` restores the pre-Task-7 assertion (all-snap,
  top_reason=NO_OWNER) and is how the red state is reproduced on an older
  tree; the default is now the owned one, so this gate fails loudly the day
  ownership regresses instead of quietly passing.

Route: Jungle Falls (level 29), MDKR_LOAD_TRACK-retargeted so the race loads
without menu navigation. Jungle Falls is the tree's own established
UV-scroll/wave witness (see check_presentation_matrix.py's
``UV_SCROLL_TRACK``): its waterfall sheet is an ordinary BHV_TEXTURE_SCROLL
level-model batch (WORLD_SCROLL) and its ping-pong water surface is the
wave-driven, still-unowned content (WATER_WAVE) in the same view. Level 5
(Ancient Lake, check_track_sweep's first track) has water but no distinct
scroller in view during an early lap and was measured to produce zero
WORLD_SCROLL rows; Jungle Falls produces all three classes reliably.

Smoothing is armed with the public ``MDKR_PRESENT_RATE=60`` /
``MDKR_PRESENT_SMOOTHING=interpolate`` pair (present rate above the tick
rate, motion smoothing on) — the same production arm condition
``present_sched_replay_armed()`` requires. The census counters accumulate
unconditionally; only the stderr rows are gated, and only on
``MDKR_SMOOTH_VERDICT=1`` on top of the usual ``MDKR_PRESENT_SCHED_TRACE=1``
that gates the whole trace dump.

# production against MDKR_TEST_SKYDOME_CAMERA_LOCK_DISABLE=1, the negative
# control that makes gfx_pc_dkr.c's G_MTX replay branch recompose a
# camera_locked entry exactly like any other -- captured tick-T translation
# held frozen against an interpolated view-projection, i.e. this fix's own
# defect reproduced on demand. The pixels that differ between the two runs
# ARE the fix's footprint; measuring "does the sky move at all" on a single
# run cannot distinguish this fix from the camera-ROTATION panning that
# already worked before it (mtx_cam_push's matrices were already recomposed
# against the interpolated camera on vp_overridden -- see gfx_pc_dkr.c:6559
# and this file's own WATER_WAVE note above). Only the frozen-translation
# defect this task closes is invisible to that broader check.

# Route: the title screen's own scripted camera fly-around (levelId 23,
# reached by simply booting -- the same "title" fixture
# check_overlay_pause_cutscene.py uses), which pans and translates hard
# enough to move the dome. MDKR_PRESENT_RATE=120 over the 30 Hz tick gives 4
