"""Hold the wave surfaces to the midpoint-sensitivity contract.

Task 7 gave the wave surfaces a presentation owner. ``check_smooth_verdict.py``
is the structural witness for that (WATER_WAVE blends, files no NO_OWNER, and
its topology guard both runs and refuses). This is the pixel witness, and it
asserts the one property no counter can: the **midpoint-sensitivity contract**
(``docs/UNCAPPED_PRESENTATION.md:198-200``) -- an image reconstructed between
two authored ticks must differ from BOTH of them, in the region the
reconstruction is responsible for. Content that is replayed rather than
reconstructed passes every endpoint check ever written, because reproducing an
endpoint is exactly what it does; that is the whole failure mode.

**The region is measured, not cropped.** A hand-picked water rectangle is a
number about the crop as much as about the water, and it goes stale the moment
the route moves. So the route is run twice from identical deterministic inputs:

* production;
* with ``MDKR_TEST_WAVE_TOPOLOGY_FLIP=1``, the negative control in
  ``game/src/waves.c``, which folds the per-tick vertex-buffer flip into the
  wave topology key. Every authored pair then reads as a topology change, the
  choke point refuses every wave blend, and the surface is replayed instead of
  reconstructed.

The pixels that differ between the two runs at a given present ARE the wave
stage's own footprint at that present. Everything else -- camera, racers,
scenery -- is identical by construction, and the gate CHECKS that rather than
assuming it: on authored frames (alpha 0) the two runs must be byte-identical,
because a snap and a blend agree exactly at their shared endpoint. If they are
not, the seam is moving something other than wave interpolation and every
figure below is attributing someone else's pixels to the wave stage.

Three claims, in the order that makes each one meaningful:

1. **endpoint identity** -- every authored frame agrees between the runs;
2. **the stage reaches the screen** -- at least ``MIN_ACTED_TICKS`` midpoints
   differ between the runs at all. This is the non-vacuity floor and the
   mutation catch in one: a build whose topology key is constant refuses
   nothing, the control becomes byte-identical to production, and this count
   collapses to zero;
3. **midpoint sensitivity** -- at every one of those midpoints, production's
   image differs from BOTH bracketing authored images over that midpoint's own
   footprint. Measured 95 of 95 on this window.

Always muted + headless. Exit 0 = pass.
