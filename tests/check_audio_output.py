"""The synthesiser really produces music, SFX and reverb — asserted on the PCM.

Why this exists
---------------
README.md and CHANGELOG.md list Audio as working: "music, SFX and reverb, via the
decompiled synthesiser driving a software mixer". Until this check landed, **not one
fixture asserted on audio at all**. Every check runs muted, by the hard rule in
CONTRIBUTING.md, so the claim rested entirely on somebody having listened to it — the
only green row in the status table with no check behind it.

Nothing here opens an audio device. `--headless-frames` returns before SDL audio is
touched, and `MDKR_AUDIO=0` is set on top of that. Synthesis still runs headlessly, so
the whole DSP path is exercised; `MDKR_AUDIO_DUMP` taps the PCM to a file and
`MDKR_AUDIO_RMS=1` prints the engine's own RMS/peak/clip/fx-guard accounting. The
capture is **ROM-derived** and is written to a temp dir that is deleted unless
--keep-audio is given; it must never be committed (`.gitignore` covers `*.wav`).

Runtime: ~12 s — two 4300-frame headless runs (~4 s each, reverb on and reverb off)
plus pure-Python analysis of 2 x 12.7 MB of PCM. No third-party modules.

What is asserted (measured values are from the reference run, US 1.1)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. FORMAT. The WAV is 22050 Hz / 2 ch / 16-bit, and the synth's own frame size is
    736.0 sample-frames per pump = 33.379 ms = two NTSC fields (33.367 ms), 0.04 %
    apart. The second half matters: a WAV header can say anything, but if the
    synthesiser's output rate were misconfigured the sample count per pump would move
    with it. The native and web sinks agree on 22050/2 (DKR_OUTPUT_RATE).

 2. NOT SILENT, and silent exactly where it should be. Whole-capture RMS 6580.4
    against a floor of 1500, every one of the eight music windows above that floor
    (2372-8908), and the pre-boot window genuinely silent: RMS 65.1 with 99.61 % of
    its samples exactly zero. That last part is what stops the RMS floor from being a
    vacuous test of "some bytes arrived" — it is real, engine-produced silence sitting
    in the same capture, and the check asserts on both.

 3. NOT SATURATED. `[AUDIO] mainbus clip` is the mixer's own count of how often the
    final sum wanted to exceed s16 full scale: 1372/12656256 = 0.01084 %, worst
    pre-clamp magnitude 38017 = 1.29 dBFS over. The WAV-side rail count agrees:
    110/6328128 = 0.00174 % of samples at +32767/-32768. Both are asserted below
    ceilings, as is the overshoot in dB.
    NOTE: the peak IS full scale (32768, i.e. a -32768 sample). This check therefore
    does NOT assert "peak below full scale" — that assertion would FAIL on correct
    audio. DKR's mix legitimately touches the rail and the RSP mixer saturates on
    hardware too. What distinguishes healthy from destroyed is the *fraction* at the
    rail and the pre-clamp overshoot, which is what is asserted.

 4. BOTH CHANNELS ALIVE AND DECORRELATED. L RMS 6594.2, R RMS 6566.5, both above the
    floor; and crucially rms(L-R) = 2864.1 with corr(L,R) = +0.9053 — not a mono
    duplicate, which gives rms(L-R) exactly 0.0 and corr exactly 1.0. The reverb and
    pan paths are what decorrelate them: with MDKR_AUDIO_REVERB=0 the same route
    measures rms(L-R) 3475.5 / corr +0.8876, so both arms are genuinely stereo.

 5. THE MUSIC CHANGES WHEN IT SHOULD. The route crosses six music sequences and a
    level load. For each pair of adjacent windows the 8-band spectral energy
    distribution must differ by an L1 distance above a floor: measured 0.525, 0.537,
    0.614, 0.747, 0.979, 0.996 and 1.145 across the seven adjacent pairs, against a
    floor of 0.15. A synthesiser stuck replaying one buffer would pass 1-4 and fail
    this — which is exactly what the `static` control below demonstrates.

 6. THE BEAT GRID SITS AT THE TEMPO THE SEQUENCER PROGRAMMED. This is the assertion
    that separates "the synth is running" from "the synth is running at the wrong
    rate", i.e. the class of bug behind the "crazy fast dance" report.

    The reference is the LIVE tempo, read out of the sequence player each frame by
    the `[AUDIO] music ... uspt=` trace added to audi_port_dkr.c: `alCSPGetTempo()`
    returns microseconds per quarter note currently in force, so it is a pure
    control-side value with no dependence on the sample clock. Comparing it against a
    period measured in samples is exactly a test of the sequencer-clock-to-sample-clock
    relationship.

    Method: 256-sample RMS envelope -> log -> half-wave-rectified first difference
    (onset strength) -> normalised autocorrelation -> comb score = mean ACF over the
    candidate period and its first four multiples. For each window the comb is scanned
    over 0.75x-1.35x the declared quarter note; the argmax must land within 2 % of
    1.00x, and the score at 1.00x must exceed the score at 0.95x/1.05x/1.12x by a
    margin. Measured:

      seq 26  182.11 BPM  q=329.47 ms  21.6 s  argmax 1.0041x  comb@q +0.3850  margin +0.3683
      seq 24  120.01 BPM  q=499.97 ms  19.6 s  argmax 0.9981x  comb@q +0.3923  margin +0.3853
      seq 10  126.01 BPM  q=476.16 ms  36.8 s  argmax 0.9996x  comb@q +0.3053  margin +0.2871

    i.e. the beat grid is within 0.4 % of the programmed tempo in every case, and the
    +-5 % detunings score *negative* (-0.02 to -0.04) — a 10x margin, not a threshold
    scraped past. 182.11 BPM for the title sequence independently confirms the 182 BPM
    / 659 ms figure from the historical title-screen animation diagnosis.

    The live readout also exposes something worth knowing: `music_tempo()`
    (sMusicTempo) is only the BPM audio.c last programmed from gSeqSoundTable, and it
    goes STALE. The attract-mode sequence 35 carries its own AL_MIDI_META_TEMPO events
    and walks 130.1 -> 140.0 -> 120.0 BPM while music_tempo() still reports 110. Using
    music_tempo() as the reference would have made this assertion measure the wrong
    number on that window. alCSPGetTempo() is the correct reference.

    Two honest limits. (a) A window with no percussive onsets has no beat grid to
    find; such windows are reported and skipped, and at least MIN_TEMPO_WINDOWS must
    remain testable so a global loss of beat structure cannot pass vacuously
    (MIN_TEMPO_WINDOWS is deliberately equal to the count the reference route yields,
    so losing any one of them is a failure). The attract-mode intro (seq 35) is one of
    these: its comb profile is flat at 0.00-0.03 across candidate periods from 60 ms to
    4 s, i.e. no periodicity anywhere rather than periodicity in the wrong place — it
    is a sustained texture, not a defect. (b) Autocorrelation cannot distinguish a
    period from an exact octave of it, so a rate error of exactly 2x or 0.5x is not
    caught here — assertion 1's samples-per-pump check is what bounds that.

 7. THE REVERB PATH ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTES. The second run with MDKR_AUDIO_REVERB=0 is
    a true engine-level A/B (audio.c gDkrReverbEnabled). 322974 samples (5.10 %) are
    bit-exactly zero in the dry capture; at those same instants the wet capture carries
    RMS 100.9 with peak 5011 — energy that can only have come from the delay lines.
    86.8 % of all samples differ between the two runs. This reproduces, as a standing
    check, the methodology recorded in docs/OPEN_ITEMS.md "M5 open items".
    `[AUDIO] fx-guard trips` must read 0 in both arms: non-zero means a delay-line DMA
    tried to leave its allocation and was clamped, which is the LP64 delay-tap overrun
    documented in the same place.

    Incidental confirmation of a documented gain-stage effect: with the FX bypassed the
    aux wet send is still summed to the main bus undelayed at unity, and the check's own
    numbers show it — reverb OFF raises the main-bus clip rate 5.1x (7019 vs 1372
    events) and the worst pre-clamp overshoot from 1.29 to 3.75 dBFS. Reverb ON is the
    better-behaved configuration, which is why it is the default.

Self-validation — this check is proven to be able to fail
---------------------------------------------------------
An audio check that cannot fail is worse than none, because it would license the claim
it is supposed to test. Two kinds of positive control, both run and both recorded:

ENGINE-LEVEL (`--control`, run manually; each must exit 1):

    --control dry-vs-dry   both arms MDKR_AUDIO_REVERB=0
                           -> assertion 7 fails: "the wet path contributes nothing
                              where the dry path is silent (rms 0.00 < 10.0)" and
                              "only 0.0 % of samples differ between reverb-on and
                              reverb-off"
    --control boot-only    200 frames, 176 of them real engine silence
                           -> assertion 2 fails on whole-capture rms 390.5 < 1500,
                              and 4, 5, 6 and 7 fall over with it

SIGNAL-LEVEL (run by default; --no-controls to skip). The same analysis is re-run over
deliberately corrupted copies of the real capture, and each control MUST trip the
assertion it targets — this check FAILS if any control passes:

    silence   all samples zeroed                      -> trips 2
    mono      R := L                                  -> trips 4
    clip      x6 gain into the rail                   -> trips 3
    static    one 0.5 s block repeated for the file   -> trips 5
    detune    resampled by 1.12x                      -> trips 6

The pre-boot silent window in assertion 2 is a third kind: real silence produced by the
game, in the same capture, asserted to be silent.

What this does NOT cover — needs a device or a human ear
-------------------------------------------------------
 * That anything is audible at all: no device is ever opened by this check.
   The separate ROM-free `audio_sink_contract` CTest proves the shared queue
   controller plus SDL open/format/drain/pause/clear path with silence (and can
   run on a physical device); real speaker output still needs a human or loopback.
 * Timbre, tuning and instrument assignment. A bank that loaded the wrong instrument,
   or an envelope with the wrong decay, produces a healthy RMS, a healthy beat grid
   and the wrong sound. Only an ear (or a golden-master comparison against hardware,
   which would be ROM-derived and cannot be committed) catches that.
 * Whether the full-scale peaks in assertion 3 are audible distortion. 0.011 % of
   samples clamping is very likely inaudible, but this check measures it rather than
   judging it.
 * Realtime game-audio sink behavior. Headless synthesis uses one deterministic block per due
   two-field audio quantum, so original NTSC game time and capture time now advance
   together (736 samples = 33.38 ms against two fields = 33.37 ms). Enhanced
   one-field simulation services audio every second game pass; grouped lateness and
   presentation-rate invariance are covered by the scheduler gates. The SDL
   contract measures bounded application-queue backlog and drain independently;
   hidden hardware-buffer underruns, audible game output, and drift against a
   physical DAC remain outside this PCM-only check.
 * An exact 2x/0.5x global rate error, per assertion 6(b).

Usage:
    tests/check_audio_output.py
    tests/check_audio_output.py --keep-audio /tmp/a   # keep the captures (ROM-derived!)
    tests/check_audio_output.py --no-controls         # skip the self-validation arms
    tests/check_audio_output.py --control dry-vs-dry  # positive control; must exit 1
    tests/check_audio_output.py --control boot-only   # positive control; must exit 1

Always runs muted + headless (MDKR_AUDIO=0 and --headless-frames), per
