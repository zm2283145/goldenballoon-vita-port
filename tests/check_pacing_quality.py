"""Presentation quality is a measured distribution, not an impression.

Pacing work has historically been judged by counting presents: the right NUMBER
of images at the right rate. That number says nothing about whether the images
arrived EVENLY, which is the whole of what a player perceives as smoothness. A
run can hit its rational present count exactly and still stutter, because the
count is a total and stutter lives in the tail.

So this gate reads the three distributions the engine now publishes at shutdown
(`[PRESENTPERF-HIST]`, one row per series) plus the present-queue latency proxy
(`[PRESENTPERF-LATENCY]`), and holds them to invariants that must be true of any
correct run:

  * every present opportunity contributes exactly one interval sample, and
    every displayed frame exactly one phase sample, so the census cannot be
    quietly dropping or double-counting the thing it claims to measure;
  * the interpolation phase never runs backwards between two displayed frames
    (`regressions=0`) and never fails to advance at all (`stalls=0`);
  * with motion smoothing off, no displayed frame may advance the phase by less
    than a whole tick -- there are no interpolated images to display, so a
    sub-tick advance would mean one was displayed anyway;
  * the audio sink never starved (`underruns=0`).

ARMS. The synthetic arms cover every presentation policy crossed with both
smoothing settings and prove the plumbing. They deliberately assert only
structural identities, never wall-clock numbers: synthetic pacing does not
sleep, so its intervals are the host loop's own speed and mean nothing as a
quality measurement.

The REALTIME arm is where the quality numbers come from -- a genuinely paced,
compositor-visible run on the display policy with smoothing. It gates the
things that must never regress (no tearing mode, no audio underrun) and
publishes the displayed-interval and phase-variance tails as the labelled
baseline for the next milestone.

M3 TURNED TWO OF THOSE REPORTS INTO GATES. M2 published them rather than gating
them for a good reason -- a threshold invented before a baseline exists is a
guess -- and M2's run is what turned them into numbers. Now that M3 has moved
them, the interpolation-phase variance and the displayed-interval p99 are held
to bounds derived from the post-M3 measurement with 2x headroom, so ordinary
machine variance cannot flake them but a real regression cannot hide either.
They are gated only on a run that actually paced (see below); publishing or
gating a number taken from a session that never throttled would be worse than
measuring nothing.

AND ONLY WHEN EVERY PACED ATTEMPT MISSES. This arm is bimodal by nature, and a
busy machine can hand one attempt a tail squarely inside the pre-M3 range --
measured, not hypothesised. No threshold can separate that from a regression,
because it IS the same number; the thing that separates them is that a
regression repeats and a transient does not. So a paced attempt that misses its
bounds is retried, and the run fails only when no paced attempt came in. The
pre-M3 build missed these bounds by 5x to 25x on every run it made, so the
retry costs nothing in detection.

THE VBLANK PROJECTION (M3 slice 1) is asserted structurally rather than
numerically, because it is a claim about WHICH VALUES ARE POSSIBLE and not
about how big they are. Under a vblank-quantized queue the engine projects the
interpolation phase onto the display's own grid and publishes that grid as
`gridppm`. So:

  * every synthetic arm must report `gridppm=0`. Synthetic pacing has no vblank
    to project onto, and the projection declining there is exactly what keeps
    those runs bit-for-bit what they were before M3 -- which is what
    tests/check_arbitrary_presentation_rates.py's byte-identity arms prove;
  * a realtime arm that paced must report a nonzero `gridppm` AND displayed
    phases that ARE grid points. A run that quietly stopped projecting would
    keep passing every count-based identity in here; only this catches it.

TASK 5 MADE AN ASSUMPTION HERE EXPLICIT. The grid-phase assertions above are
only meaningful on a fixed present interval -- projecting onto a grid a panel
is not actually holding to would be dishonest, which is exactly what Task 5's
measured-variance decline in `platform_present_display_quantum_units()` now
refuses to do. That decline is real: this project's own M3 Max development
machine has a ProMotion (ADAPTIVE-refresh) built-in display, and a genuinely
unthrottled `MDKR_PRESENT_QUANTUM_STRICT`-free run on it measures present
interval variance well above the 2500ppm threshold, so `gridppm` legitimately
comes back 0 there. The main realtime arm below sets
`MDKR_PRESENT_QUANTUM_STRICT=1` for exactly this reason -- it pins today's
always-grid regime so this arm keeps measuring the SAME thing it always did,
on any panel, fixed or adaptive. The variance-honest path itself is covered
separately by a companion arm, WITHOUT strict, that asserts `[ALPHA-QUANTUM]`'s
reported `mode` matches what its own `variance_ppm` implies -- `free` above
the threshold, `grid` at or below it -- so it is a real assertion on any
machine rather than a hardcoded expectation tied to this one.

THE DISPLAY-CHANGE ARM (M3 slice 2) covers a window moving to a monitor with a
different refresh. What can be automated is everything downstream of the event:
MDKR_TEST_DISPLAY_RATE_SWITCH=<hz>@<tick> makes the host report a different
refresh at a chosen tick and runs the same handler SDL's display-changed event
does, and the arm asserts the backend re-ranked its present mode against the
new number rather than keeping the one baked at configuration.

  MANUAL STEP, NOT COVERED HERE: SDL's delivery of
  SDL_WINDOWEVENT_DISPLAY_CHANGED itself needs two monitors of different
  refresh, which no headless run has. To check it by hand, start a windowed run
  with MDKR_PRESENT_RATE=display and drag the window between the two monitors;
  stderr must show one `[PRESENT-DISPLAY] event=display-changed` row per
  crossing with the two refresh rates, followed by a re-emitted `[PRESENT-MODE]`
  row carrying the new `displayHz`. A refresh change on the SAME display raises
  no SDL event at all and still needs a relaunch, which is what the pacing
  keys' SCOPE_RESTART already tells the player.

WHEN THE ENVIRONMENT CANNOT PRODUCE A BASELINE. Two session conditions make the
realtime numbers meaningless without anything being wrong in the code:

  * no display session at all -- a locked screen or a session with no window
    server refuses every drawable, and the run measures a pacer nothing is
    consuming (`explain_no_display_session`);
  * a session that accepts presents without vsync-blocking them -- the display
    policy installs no software limiter and relies on FIFO to pace it, so an
    unthrottled surface lets the loop free-run and produces a displayed cadence
    far faster than the host's own refresh (`explain_unthrottled_presentation`).

Both are detected and named explicitly rather than reported as a generic
missing-marker failure -- the same distinction check_app_adopted_pacing draws,
and for the same reason: the generic message sends debugging into the pacing
code, which is the wrong place. In both cases the no-tearing and no-underrun
assertions still run, because neither can be excused by the environment; only
the BASELINE is withheld, since publishing it would seed M3's targets from a
measurement of nothing. The synthetic arms still prove the plumbing.

This arm is genuinely bimodal on a developer machine: the same command can
vsync-throttle on one run and free-run on the next, depending on how the
compositor treats the automation window. Read the printed baseline, or its
absence, rather than assuming a run produced one.
