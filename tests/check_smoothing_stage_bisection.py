"""Attribute presentation smoothing to its individual stages at 120 Hz.

Motion smoothing is not one mechanism. It is seven independently gated stages
that all run inside the same interpolated replay walk, and until now the only
question any gate asked about them was "does this stage change pixels at all"
(``check_presentation_matrix.py``'s arm C controls). That answer is a yes/no
per stage against a *different* route each. It cannot say which stage carries
most of the visible motion on one route, and it therefore cannot tell an
artifact hunt where to look.

This gate answers the ranking question. It renders the same scripted route at
``MDKR_PRESENT_RATE=120`` against the 30 Hz authoritative tick — three
intermediate presents between every pair of authored images, which is the
densest alpha grid production can request on a 120 Hz display — once per stage
configuration:

* **all-on** — production behaviour, the reference every other arm is
  differenced against;
* **all-off** — every stage's opt-out set, so only the interpolated camera
  moves. This is the attribution ceiling and the harness's non-vacuity control;
* **leave-one-out**, once per stage — exactly one opt-out set. The difference
  from all-on is that stage's contribution *in the presence of all the others*,
  which is the number an artifact hunt needs; a stage measured alone would be
  measured in a scene the other six never composed.

Two routes, because no single one exercises all seven stages:

* **Route A — Jungle Falls (level 29), in-race, shields forced.** Carries
  object roots, model deformation, vertex shade, primitive alpha, shield shear
  and authored UV scroll. It ranks the stages.
* **Route B — battle challenge (level 26).** The only witness in the tree for
  world-space point-trail meshes: route A registers particle vertices but never
  interpolates one (``particledeformoverride=0``), so route A's particle arm
  would report "no contribution" for a stage that simply never fired. Route B
  measures it where it does.

What each arm asserts
---------------------

* **Authority is untouched.** Every arm's ``[SIMHASH]``/``[EVENTHASH]``/
  ``[INPUTHASH]`` stream must be byte-identical to its route's all-on arm.
  These envs are presentation-only by construction; a stream that moves is a
  real defect in the stage, not a harness artifact, and is reported as one.
* **Authored endpoints are exact.** At 120 Hz every fourth present is the real
  walk's own image. Those frames must be byte-identical across every arm —
  a stage that changes an endpoint has escaped the replay.
* **The opt-out actually reached the binary.** Each leave-one-out arm must
  drive the left-out stage's ``[PRESENT-PACKET]`` reach counter to exactly
  zero. Without this the harness's worst failure is silent: a mistyped env
  name produces an arm identical to all-on, and its zero pixel difference is
  indistinguishable from a stage that ran and changed nothing. Real zeros of
  the second kind exist in this table, so "zero difference" cannot validate
  itself.
* **The instrument is not vacuous.** all-off must differ from all-on on at
  least one intermediate frame, and every ranked stage must both be *reached*
  and *fire* — a non-zero override — on its route. A stage that is reached but
  never substitutes anything is reported as ``reached-never-interpolated``, one
  that is never reached at all as ``absent``; neither is ever silently read as
  innocence. All seven stages get an explicit ``[STAGE-DISPOSITION]`` row on
  both routes, ranked or not.
* **Every replayed recipe is anchored to its own tick.** A reconstruction
  measures its capture-time residual against the alpha-zero pose, and that
  cancels only if the two describe the same authored tick. Every production arm
  asserts ``ownertickmismatch=0`` over a non-zero ``ownertickcheck``, for all
  four recipe classes, and the assertion first requires both fields to be
  *present*. This is the exact witness for the shield/magnet anchoring defect
  that shipped in v1.0.1-v1.0.3 and read 708 of 708 violations on route A; the
  pixel-level backstop is ``check_effect_shell_envelope.py``.
* **Every UV-scroll hold is attributed.** A held scroll batch steps its texture
  phase at the authored tick rate while the surface around it glides, so the
  hold rate is a visible quantity and its *clauses* are what disposition it.
  Each route's all-on arm asserts the four clause counters account for the
  aggregate exactly, and prints the split as ``[UV-SCROLL-HOLDS]``.
* **The primitive-alpha magnitude census is arithmetically alive.** An
  override is a changed alpha byte, so ``primalphadeltasum`` can never be
  below ``primalphaoverride`` and the peak can never be zero while overrides
  fire. That identity is what stops the counter whose numbers disposition
  artifact class C9 from silently accumulating nothing. Printed as
  ``[PRIM-ALPHA-MAGNITUDE]``.

The uncaptured-external arm
---------------------------

The same run shape carries the evidence for the retained-pointer fail-closed
path. ``dkr_retain_resolved_pointer`` refuses an interpolated walk that
resolves a non-arena dependency with no retained copy. On a correct tree that
branch is unreachable, so **every** production arm — all-on, all-off and each
leave-one-out, on both routes — asserts ``uncapturedext=0``, and the assertion
first requires the stat field to be *present*: a lookup with a default would
pass silently the day the counter is renamed. The covered arm and replay counts
are printed as ``[UNCAPTURED-OWNERSHIP]`` rather than summed by hand.
``MDKR_TEST_UNCAPTURED_EXTERNAL`` (token-gated) then forces every external
lookup to miss and asserts the walks refuse — holding the authored image —
rather than reading live memory.

# obj_loop_texscroll advances a level texture through a TWO-BIT accumulator:
# it adds the authored rate (quarter-units a tick) to a residue, emits the
# whole units that completes and keeps the rest. An authored rate that is a
# multiple of four therefore emits the same whole-unit step every tick, and a
# rate that is not alternates its step by one, forever.
#
# Jungle Falls' waterfall is the first kind -- 32 quarter-units a tick at
# updateRate 2, so 16 whole units every tick, and it confirms on every
# lookup. Both existing arms that exercise UV scroll run Jungle Falls ONLY,
# so neither has ever driven the second kind. Level 19 is the second kind
# twice over (authored V rates 127 and 85, both odd), which is what makes it
# the arm that can fail: with the authored rate absent, no two of its ticks
# can agree, so the two-tick confirmation rule cannot recover them.
#
# WHERE they land when the authored rate is absent depends only on batch
# shape, and this changed under the test. Both of level 19's fractional
# scrollers are MULTI-triangle batches, and de1f713b (2026-08-17) taught the
# measured path that one fold-resolved displacement shared across a batch's
# triangles is itself the second observation -- so a multi-triangle batch is
# recovered by cross-triangle corroboration into `uvscrollsolo` rather than
# held. A SINGLE-triangle fractional scroller has no such witness, keeps the
# two-tick rule, and holds its texture phase on every interpolated present
# while the world glides past it -- the shimmer the authored rate exists to
# remove, and the whole population this arm measured when it was written
# (2026-08-09, before de1f713b). Either way the batch is still interpolated
