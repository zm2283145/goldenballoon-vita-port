"""Save-file fail-safe check: a corrupt save must never strand the player.

Why this exists
---------------
The published browser build keeps `save/eeprom.bin` in IndexedDB, so whatever is
in it comes back on every reload.  That makes the save file the one piece of
*persistent untrusted input* in the whole port: if a bad image can send the boot
somewhere the player cannot get out of, a visitor is stuck for good — the page
had no control that clears saved progress, and "clear site data" is not something
a visitor thinks to do.  A report of exactly that ("every time I boot I get
dropped into a race" -- later corrected by the owner to "after navigating all
screens it boots into a genie test which we already completed") is what prompted
this file.

Three real defects came out of the investigation, and this check covers all of
them.  The corrected symptom is defect 3.

**1. The image was accepted at any length, and interpreted whatever it held.**
`eeprom_load()` (platform/stubs_dkr.c) `fread` the file and ignored the count, so
a short file was interpreted with its missing tail read as zeros, and the next
`eeprom_store()` promoted that half-image to a full, canonical 512 bytes — the
original bytes gone, silently.  A short file is not hypothetical: the old store
did `fopen(path, "wb")`, which truncates *before* anything is written, so a crash
mid-write left 0..511 bytes on disk.  The store is now atomic (write `.tmp`,
`rename()` over the real path) and the load validates: exactly 512 bytes, and
every block either erased (all 0xFF), blank (all 0x00), or checksum-valid, per
save_layout.h.  Anything else is copied to `save/eeprom.bin.bad` and replaced with
the state the game itself defines for "empty".  Nothing is destroyed silently and
the rejection is loud.

**2. A checksum-VALID slot with an impossible field could SIGSEGV, every boot.**
The slot checksum is a plain 16-bit byte sum, which corrupt bytes satisfy by
chance: 4 of 40 randomly-corrupted-but-checksum-valid images crashed the engine.
All four narrowed to one field.  `settings->wizpigAmulet` is 3 bits on disk (so
0..7) but the amulet has FOUR pieces — the game's own tests are `>= 4` and
vehicle_tricky.c uses `wizpigAmulet - 1` as a 0..3 index — and objects.c's
BHV_DYNAMIC_LIGHT_OBJECT_2 spawn does `assetCount = wizpigAmulet + 1;
modelIndex = wizpigAmulet` with no clamp against the object's numberOfModelIds.
Values 5 and 7 therefore load out-of-range model ids on Timber's Island and then
SIGSEGV inside the racer collision path (`func_80054FD0`, from
`update_player_racer`) about 750 frames after the hub appears.  In the browser
that is a permanent boot loop: crash, reload, same save from IndexedDB, crash.
`populate_settings_from_save_data()` now rejects such a slot under NATIVE_PORT
using the function's own idiom for "this is not a save" (leave `newGame` TRUE),
so the game erases the slot and FILE SELECT offers an unstarted file.

**3. A save whose two halves of Taj progress disagree wedges Timber's Island.**
Reported from the published build as "after navigating all the menus it puts me
into a genie test we already completed".  `tajFlags` holds car/hover/plane
challenge OFFERED (0x01/0x02/0x04) and the same three BEATEN (0x08/0x10/0x20),
written at two different moments by two different functions.  The offer gate
(`objects.c:1794`) consults only the OFFERED half, and the auto-offer dialogue
chain never asks — `DIALOGUEPAGE_TAJ_CHALLENGE_CAR` falls through to
`DIALOGUEPAGE_TAJ_4`, which returns `(gNextTajChallengeMenu - 1) | 0x40` and
starts the race.  So "beaten but never offered" replays a finished challenge on
every entry to the hub, and Taj's dialogue calls `disable_racer_input()` every
frame it is open: measured 76% of the run stationary, 14439 units driven against
37768 healthy.  `populate_settings_from_save_data()` now ORs OFFERED in from
BEATEN, which is sound in that direction only (a challenge cannot be beaten
without having been offered) and is a no-op on every consistent save.

What this asserts
-----------------
  1. **A torn save boots to the TITLE SCREEN.**  menuId 0 must be reached, and the
     only levels loaded before it may be the two the healthy boot loads
     (OPTIONSBACKGROUND behind the boot logo, FRONTEND behind the logos).  A race
     level_load before the title fails.
  2. **A full-length garbage save does the same.**
  3. **Both were really consumed and really rejected**, not merely absent:
     `save/eeprom.bin.bad` must exist afterwards and be byte-identical to the
     bytes fed in, and `save/eeprom.bin` must be a clean 512-byte image.  This is
     what stops case 1/2 passing vacuously — an absent save produces no `.bad`
     file, which case 4 pins down explicitly.
  4. **The poison save runs the Adventure resume route without crashing**, and
     *reaches Timber's Island* while doing it.  The reach assertion is coverage,
     not decoration: without it, a future fixture change that stopped entering
     the hub would leave every other assertion passing while exercising none of
     the code that crashed.
  5. **The control (no save at all) boots clean and produces no quarantine.**
  6. **A save whose Taj progress contradicts itself does not wedge the hub.**
     `tajFlags` records "car challenge beaten" without "car challenge offered";
     the kart must still drive Timber's Island normally. Measured by path length
     and stalled-row fraction, because the damage is that Taj comes over and holds
     the racer's input down, not a crash.

Proven in both directions
-------------------------
With the fixes reverted, measured on us.v80 (both controls were run, not reasoned
about):
  * revert eeprom_load()'s validation in platform/stubs_dkr.c -> 3 failures:
        torn: save/eeprom.bin.bad was not created …
        torn: save/eeprom.bin is 100 bytes after the run, expected 512
        garbage: save/eeprom.bin.bad was not created …
  * revert the amulet rejection in game/src/save_data.c -> 3 failures:
        poison: run produced [CRASH]/[FATAL] …
        poison: run exited -11 (negative = killed by signal 11) …
        poison: slot 0 was not erased (first bytes 002c00000000) …
  * revert the BEATEN-implies-OFFERED repair in game/src/save_data.c -> 2 failures:
        taj: the kart only drove 14439.4 units (need >= 25000.0) …
        taj: the kart was stationary for 76% of the run (limit 45%) …

Usage:
    tests/check_save_failsafe.py [--build build] [--rom baserom.us.v80.z64] [-v]

Always runs muted + headless (MDKR_AUDIO=0 and --headless-frames), per
tests/README.md.  Exit 0 = pass; exit 1 = at least one assertion failed (each
printed with the measured value).

The save directory is wiped before AND after every case.  That is load-bearing,
not tidiness: a leftover save sends FILE SELECT down the resume path and would
break check_adventure_hub.py, which asserts the new-game cutscene.
