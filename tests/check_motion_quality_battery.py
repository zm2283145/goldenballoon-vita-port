"""The perceptual failure modes of interpolated presentation, one row each.

Motion smoothing reconstructs three of every four images a player sees on a
120 Hz display. The tree already has gates for the *mechanism* of that
reconstruction -- which stage moved what, whether a recipe was anchored to its
own tick, whether an ownership lookup refused. What it did not have until now
is a single gate that states, in the vocabulary a player would use, the things
a reconstruction is never allowed to do:

    a kart may not spin the wrong way round;
    a respawn may not be smeared across the screen;
    a camera cut may not be blended through;
    time may not run backwards;
    the authored tick may not thump.

Those are rows R1..R6 below. Their taxonomy, the measurements that named them
and the dispositions that closed them are in
``docs/evidence/smoothing-artifact-repro-2026-08.md`` -- classes C1..C9, the
gate design in §2.6, the dispositions in §5. This gate is the standing form of
that note: the release gate future presentation work has to keep green.

Every row has a NEGATIVE CONTROL
--------------------------------

A gate that has only ever been green proves that it ran, not that it can fail.
So each row that drives a scenario also runs a committed, token-gated arm that
provably turns it red, in the same run, on the same route, and the gate FAILS
if that arm comes back green. The controls are code (``presentation_snapshot.c``,
seam block at the top), not prose:

* R1 ``MDKR_TEST_ROTATION_LONG_ARC`` -- every interpolated angle takes the long
  way round the circle instead of the short one. Artifact class C3.
* R2 ``MDKR_TEST_IGNORE_DISCONTINUITY`` -- the spawn/teleport/cut flag stops
  being honoured, so replay blends across a respawn. The object-side sibling of
  class C2.

Both are inert without ``MDKR_INTERNAL_TEST_TOKEN``, both are presentation-only
by construction, and this gate proves the second claim rather than asserting
it: every control arm's ``[SIMHASH]``/``[EVENTHASH]``/``[INPUTHASH]`` stream
must be byte-identical to the production arm it is a control for. A seam that
moved a hash would be a real defect in the seam, and is reported as one.

What this gate deliberately does NOT re-drive
---------------------------------------------

Two rows are cross-references. ``check_camera_snapshot_coverage.py`` already
classifies camera cuts out of raw poses and demands the snapshot refused to
pair across each one; ``check_effect_shell_envelope.py`` already holds the
effect shell inside its endpoint-to-endpoint envelope. Re-driving either here
would double the suite's cost to re-derive a verdict that already exists.

So R3 and R6 assert something cheaper and, for a consolidating battery, more
load-bearing: that the referenced gate is still REGISTERED in
``tools/run_checks.py``'s manifest, in a role the release suite runs. That is
what keeps a citation honest. The suite runner fails closed on any
``tests/check_*.py`` that is not registered, and runs every check that is --
so "registered in a release role" plus the suite's own verdict is exactly
"green", while a future consolidation that deleted or demoted one of them would
break this gate's citation instead of silently un-covering the class.

The stat contract
-----------------

Every counter this gate reads is checked for PRESENCE before its value is read.
A dict lookup with a default silently passes the day a counter is renamed,
which turns the strongest claim a gate makes into a no-op. Two of the rows
below assert a zero, and a zero that comes from a missing field looks exactly
like a zero that comes from correct behaviour -- so each of those also asserts
its own non-vacuity witness, a companion counter that must be non-zero for the
zero to mean anything.

Always muted + headless. Exit 0 = pass.

# The calibration (note §5.1, same route, same window). Note §5.1 reports two
# forms of this statistic and they are NOT interchangeable: the POOLED form
# averages all boundary steps against all interior steps in the window, while
# the PAIRED form uses only ticks that contributed all four of their steps.
# This gate computes the PAIRED form, because the hold guard below drops
# contaminated ticks whole and a tick that contributed three interiors but no
# boundary step would otherwise put a full step next to a mean taken over
# fewer:
#
#   shipped 1.0.1-1.0.3 production, with the C1 anchoring defect   +16.68% pooled
#   fixed build, production                                         +3.73% pooled
#   fixed build, production, PAIRED -- what this gate computes      +2.93%
#   camera-only arm -- what wholly uncovered content looks like    +18.17% pooled
#
# Only the fixed build has both forms published, and the pooled figures sit
# slightly above their paired counterparts, so the historical comparison is
# indicative rather than exact. It does not have to be exact: 8% is placed in
# the empty band between the two populations, 2.7x above what the build
# actually measures and half the margin a C1-class regression reopens. It is a
# REGRESSION bound, not a quality target -- the
# residual it permits is dominated by the 2D HUD, which is authored screen-space
# texrects with no world pose pair to interpolate and reads +10.00% on its own
# whether every stage is on or every stage is off (§5.1). Tightening it toward

    # ---- R5 TICK-BOUNDARY STEP -------------------------------------------
    #
    # Steps are grouped into the tick they live inside before any mean is
    # taken, for two reasons. The comparison is WITHIN a tick -- one boundary
    # step against that tick's own three interiors -- so a tick contributing
    # only some of its steps would put a full step next to a mean taken over
    # fewer, which is not the same quantity. And it is what makes the hold
    # guard below able to drop a contaminated tick whole.
    #
    # THE HOLD GUARD. A held present is not a new image: the backend re-reads
    # the frame it already showed, so a hold lands in the dump as a step of
    # exactly zero. That biases R5's ratio in whichever direction it falls --
    # an interior hold shrinks the interior mean and inflates the excess, a
    # boundary hold shrinks the boundary mean and hides one. This route holds
    # 36 of 12,920 presents run-wide (0.28%), so a 120-frame window usually
    # contains none, and the diagnosis note's §5.1(c) checked exactly that by
    # hand ("none of the 119 steps in the sampled window is zero"). Usually is
    # not a property, so the check is made rather than assumed: any tick
    # carrying a zero step is dropped whole and counted, and the row prints the
    # count so a green verdict says which population it was taken over.
    #
    # The guard is reachable by construction and has been demonstrated: the
    # same arm at MDKR_PRESENT_SMOOTHING=off repeats each authored image three
    # times byte for byte at this rate (note §3, `a120-off`: 9,693 stale
    # presents), which drops every tick in the window and trips the floor
    # below. A scene static enough to produce a zero step without a hold would
    # also be dropped, which is the safe direction: R5 measures motion, and a
    # tick with no motion in it has nothing to say about the shape of motion.
