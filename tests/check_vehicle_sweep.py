"""Drive every playable track in every vehicle that track actually permits.

Why this exists
---------------
`tests/check_track_sweep.py` sweeps all 20 playable tracks -- but with NO
`--vehicle` it sweeps them all in the **car**, and that is not obvious. The
`MDKR_LOAD_TRACK=<level>[:<vehicle>]` hook rewrites the level id at `level_load()`,
which happens long after the menus have already chosen the vehicle from
`leveltable_vehicle_default(gTrackIdForPreview)` -- and the previewed track is
always Ancient Lake, whose default is the car. So every race this port had ever
validated, on every track, was a car race. Diddy Kong Racing has three player
vehicles with genuinely separate physics modules (`update_player_racer()`'s
`switch (vehicleID)` -> `func_8004F7F4` / `func_80046524` / `func_80049794`), and
several tracks cannot be raced in a car at all.

That gap was real: the very first plane race ever run aborted in
`__stack_chk_fail` inside `func_80049794` -- `f32 sp60[4]` holding the 4x4 MtxF
that `mtxf_from_transform()` writes, a 48-byte stack overflow, exit 134 with
nothing at all on stderr. See the comment at that declaration in racer.c.

Which combinations are legitimate
---------------------------------
Not all 60. `LevelHeader.available_vehicles` (ROM offset 0x4E) is a bitmask of the
vehicles the track-select menu will offer, and `LevelHeader.vehicle` (0x4D) is the
one it defaults to; `level_global_init()` packs them into
`gGlobalLevelTable[i].vehicles` as `(available << 4) | (default & 0xF)`, which
`leveltable_vehicle_usable()` / `leveltable_vehicle_default()` read back.
Forcing a plane onto a hovercraft-only track is not a bug, it is a meaningless
input, so this check sweeps exactly the mask -- 47 combinations.

The mask is decoded here straight from the ROM, INDEPENDENTLY of any port code
(same approach as tools/dump_misc_asset.py), and then cross-checked against the
game's own reading, published by `level_global_init()` as
`[TRACE] level_vehicles: id=N default=D avail=0xM`. If the header offsets, the
`<<4` packing or the asset-table lookup ever drift, the two disagree and this
check fails instead of quietly sweeping the wrong matrix.

Two tracks narrow the mask further, but only for two-or-more players
(`menu.c`, `VERSION >= VERSION_79`): Spaceport Alpha (15) drops the hovercraft and
Frosty Village (28) drops the plane. This is a one-player sweep, so both are swept
in all three vehicles; `--two-player-mask` applies the 2P narrowing instead.

What it asserts, per combination
--------------------------------
  1. the process exits 0 (no crash, no abort)
  2. the intended level loaded as a race **with the requested vehicle**
  3. the racer really was updated by that vehicle module -- `[PVEH]` reports the
     `vehicleID` `update_player_racer()` dispatches on, so a silently-ignored
     override cannot pass 47 rows by driving a car every time. `VEHICLE_LOOPDELOOP`
     is additionally permitted mid-race, and marked `+loopdeloop` in the report: a
     per-track trigger object swaps the racer into the loop physics module over
     corkscrew sections and restores `vehicleIDPrev` after. Walrus Cove (6) and
     DarkMoon Caverns (32) do it, which is how that module got covered at all.
  4. the racer produced position samples, all finite
  5. real forward progress (`courseCheckpoint` climbed) and real displacement
  6. a plane must actually use the vertical axis -- `y` has to move, so "loads,
     'drives', and sits at one altitude" is a failure and not a pass
  7. no [FATAL] / sanitizer / assertion text appeared
  8. per track, the vehicles must produce DISTINCT trajectories -- two vehicles
     tracing the same path means the override did nothing

Usage:
    tests/check_vehicle_sweep.py                 # the full legitimate matrix (47)
    tests/check_vehicle_sweep.py --taj           # the same matrix as playable Taj
    tests/check_vehicle_sweep.py --vehicles 1,2  # hovercraft + plane rows only
    tests/check_vehicle_sweep.py --tracks 6,15
    tests/check_vehicle_sweep.py --matrix        # print the matrix and exit
    tests/check_vehicle_sweep.py --expect-fail 15:1

Always runs muted + headless (MDKR_AUDIO=0 and --headless-frames), per
tests/README.md. Exit 0 = every combination passed (or failed only as expected).
