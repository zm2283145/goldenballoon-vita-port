"""A one-shot cutscene must play ONCE: the world-key "challenge door unlocked"
sequence, and the latch that is supposed to suppress it.

Why this exists
---------------
Reported from the published browser build: *"I collected the Key on the first
race, and now the key animation is playing after EVERY race."*

`level_load()` (game/src/game.c) is where a world hub decides to redirect into the
"your key just unlocked the Challenge door" cutscene.  The gate is

    if (settings->keys & (1 << world) &&
        !(settings->cutsceneFlags & (CUTSCENE_DINO_DOMAIN_KEY << (world + 31))))

and the body ORs the same expression into `cutsceneFlags` as the "already shown"
latch.  `world` is 1..4 here, so that shift count is **32..35**.  The ROM means it:
MIPS `sllv` takes the count from the low five bits of the register, so `<< 32` is
`<< 0` and the four worlds land on 0x4000/0x8000/0x10000/0x20000 exactly as
`structs.h` documents them.  In C a shift count >= the operand width is
**undefined behaviour**, and this is the shape an optimiser can see straight
through: the enclosing `world > WORLD_CENTRAL_AREA && world < WORLD_FUTURE_FUN_LAND`
pins the count to a range that is *entirely* >= 32, so clang concludes the value is
poison and folds it to zero.

A mask of zero breaks the latch in both directions at once: `!(flags & 0)` is
always true, so the gate always fires, and `flags |= 0` is a no-op, so nothing is
ever recorded — not in RAM, not in the save.  The cutscene therefore replays on
every single entry to that world's hub, which is to say after every race in it,
for ever.

The port's **native build defaults to Debug and the web build to Release**
(CMakeLists.txt:6-14).  At `-O0` clang emits a real register shift and arm64 masks
the count modulo 32 just like MIPS, so the same source is correct — which is why
this was invisible to every native check and visible immediately to the owner in
the browser.  Measured on this route, Release vs Debug, same save and same ROM:

    -O0   keycutscene: world=1 keys=0x2 cutsceneFlags=0x0     mask=0x4000  -> fires
          keycutscene: world=1 keys=0x2 cutsceneFlags=0x44000 mask=0x4000  -> latched, silent
    -O2   keycutscene: world=1 keys=0x2 cutsceneFlags=0x0     mask=0x0     -> fires
          keycutscene: world=1 keys=0x2 cutsceneFlags=0x40000 mask=0x0     -> FIRES AGAIN

and the user-visible difference is one extra load of the world hub on the way back
from the race, which is the cutscene playing:

    fixed  : level 12 @10709 -> level 0 @11057          (one hub load)
    broken : level 12 @10709 -> level 12 @11435 -> 0 @11783   (cutscene, then hub)

The fix is `DKR_SHL32()` (game/include/macros.h), which makes the MIPS masking
explicit under `NATIVE_PORT` and leaves the expression untouched for a matching
ROM build.  Three more instances of the same idiom were found and fixed with it —
see docs/OPEN_ITEMS.md wave "keyshift".

What this asserts
-----------------
  1. **The route really ran.**  levelId 0 (Timber's Island) -> 12 (Dino Domain
     lobby) -> 5 (Ancient Lake) -> 12 -> 0, and real in-race motion on Ancient
     Lake.  This is coverage, not decoration: every assertion below is about what
     happens on the *second* entry to level 12, so a fixture change that stopped
     entering the hub twice would leave them all passing while testing nothing.
  2. **The world hub's key gate is evaluated exactly twice** — once on the way in,
     once returning from the race.  That is what makes assertion 4 meaningful.
  3. **The latch mask is non-zero.**  This is the root cause stated directly: a
     mask of 0x0 in the trace *is* the bug, whatever else happens to be true.
  4. **The cutscene is not replayed.**  The first evaluation sees the latch clear
     (the key was just collected, so the cutscene is due) and the second must see
     it SET.  Additionally the return leg must contain exactly ONE load of
     levelId 12 — the count that distinguishes "returned to the lobby" from
     "returned to the lobby via the cutscene again".
  5. **The latch reaches the save.**  Slot 0 of `save/eeprom.bin` must have bit
     0x4000 in `cutsceneFlags` afterwards.  In the browser the save lives in
     IndexedDB, so a latch that is only ever set in RAM comes back cleared on the
     next reload and the player sees the cutscene again for a second reason.
  6. **The process exits 0** with no `[CRASH]`/`[FATAL]`.

Proven in both directions
-------------------------
Run against a build configured with `-DMDKR_EXTRA_C_FLAGS=-DMDKR_SHL32_CONTROL`,
which restores the plain C shift and nothing else, at `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`:

    key: the key-cutscene latch mask is 0x0, so the latch can never be set or
         tested (game.c's `CUTSCENE_DINO_DOMAIN_KEY << (world + 31)` folded to 0)
    key: the cutscene fired again on the return to the world hub -- cutsceneFlags
         0x40000 still lacks 0x4000 after it had already played once
    key: 2 loads of levelId 12 on the return leg, expected 1 (the extra load is
         the replayed cutscene)
    key: save slot 0 cutsceneFlags 0x40000 lacks bit 0x4000 after the run

The same build at `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` PASSES with the control define set,
which is the point: the defect is a property of the optimiser, so a Debug-only
check cannot see it.  Pass `--expect-fail` to assert that the run fails, which is
how the control is exercised without hand-reading the output.

Usage:
    tests/check_key_cutscene_once.py [--build build-rel] [--rom baserom.us.v80.z64]
                                     [--expect-fail] [-v]

Always runs muted + headless (MDKR_AUDIO=0 and --headless-frames), per
tests/README.md.  Exit 0 = pass; exit 1 = at least one assertion failed (each
printed with the measured value).

The save directory is wiped before AND after the run.  That is load-bearing, not
tidiness: this check *injects* a save, and a leftover one sends FILE SELECT down
the resume path in check_adventure_hub.py / check_adventure_race_loop.py, both of
which assert the new-game route.
