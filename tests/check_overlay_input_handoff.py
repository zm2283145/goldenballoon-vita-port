"""Give the pad back on every overlay close, not only the ones dispatch sees.

Issue #20: opening the pause menu with the controller and then activating its
on-screen "Resume" button killed controller input for the rest of the session,
while F1 and the controller's B/Circle back button were fine.  The difference
is not the device, it is *where* the menu closed.  F1, Escape, the pad's menu
button and B all close it from inside the overlay's SDL event handler, so the
pump saw the capture state change across one event and released the pad.
Resume closes it from the RENDER callback -- mouse, Enter, or ImGui gamepad
nav alike -- and there is no event across which the state changes, so the
suppression latch stayed set forever.

The contract this pins is therefore about the shape of the handoff rather than
one button: suppression is reconciled against the overlay's live answer, by one
shared routine, before dispatch as well as across it.  A source contract is the
right level for it -- the latch is a file-static inside the SDL pump, and the
behaviour that broke was the *absence* of a call, which no run of the paths
that still worked could ever reveal.
