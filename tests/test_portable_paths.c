/*
 * Unit coverage for the issue #33 portable / write-fallback path policy in
 * platform/user_paths.c.
 *
 * Two independent process modes keep the lazy portable-mode detection (which
 * caches once per process) from having to be re-armed inside a single run:
 *
 *   default     A portable.txt is created beside THIS test executable before any
 *               path query. Config, save, and mods must then resolve next to the
 *               executable, and an environment override must still win over it.
 *
 *   --fallback  No portable.txt. The getters return their historical
 *               CWD-relative defaults until a simulated home-directory write
 *               failure activates the fallback, after which every path resolves
 *               next to the executable and the relocation notice latches.
 *
 * The two modes never share on-disk state: only the default mode ever creates
 * portable.txt, and it removes it before exiting, so a parallel --fallback run
 * cannot observe it. The executable directory is derived here independently of
 * user_paths.c so the assertions cannot pass by echoing the code under test.
