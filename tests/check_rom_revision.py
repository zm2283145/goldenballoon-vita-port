"""ROM identification + byte-order normalisation must hold, on both sides.

Why this exists
---------------
The ROM gate used to be "12 MB, N64 magic, internal title contains 'diddy'".
ALL FIVE released Diddy Kong Racing revisions pass all three, and each one keeps
its master asset lookup table at a DIFFERENT ROM offset (from the decomp's own
ver/splat/dkr.*.yaml: us.v77 0xECB60, pal.v77 0xECBF0, jpn.v79 0xEE5D0,
us.v80 0xED0E0, pal.v80 0xED170). So handing this build a European or Japanese
cart did not produce an error -- it read the LUT from the wrong offset and
carried on. Measured, before platform/rom_id.c existed:

    us.v77   entry count reads 3,886,268,156 -> derived ASSET_AUDIO_TABLE size
             -453,982,075 -> SIGSEGV in sw32_arr (asset_swap_lut)
    pal.v77  entry count reads   830,361,298 -> size -1,327,275,831 -> same SIGSEGV
    pal.v80  entry count reads 0 -> 0 < 38 so asset_table_load() returns NULL ->
             SIGSEGV in audio_init dereferencing addrPtr[ASSET_AUDIO_2]
    jpn.v79  entry count reads 0 -> the same NULL path

Four SIGSEGVs before the first rendered frame, from a gate that said the ROM was
fine. That is HANDOFF.md section 3's dominant shape: no diagnostic, no useful
error. The fix is to identify the revision (header CRC1/CRC2 first, then media +
cart id + country + revision nibble), point the loader at THAT revision's LUT, and
refuse the revisions this build is not validated for, NAMING them.
docs/ROM_REVISIONS.md has the full per-revision taxonomy.

Two revisions are supported: us.v80 and pal.v80. pal.v80's entire claim to support
is that its asset payload is BYTE-IDENTICAL to us.v80's -- all 50 LUT-delimited
sections hash the same -- so assertion 5 below requires it to render and drive
byte-identically. If that ever stops holding, the premise was wrong and the
support claim has to be withdrawn, which is why it is a check and not a comment.

The second half is byte order. The browser shell advertised .v64/.n64 support by
magic while neither side said whether anything CONVERTED them (rom_io.c did; the
shell did not know, and persisted the swapped bytes to IDBFS). Accepting a
byteswapped image without converting it is worse than rejecting it -- every asset
would be read through a transposition, which in this codebase means silent
denormals, not a crash. So both sides now normalise, and this check proves the
converted images are not merely accepted but behave IDENTICALLY.

What is asserted
----------------
  1. IDENTIFICATION, per revision actually present (any absent one SKIPS, so this
     check still passes on a machine with only the supported ROM):
       - us.v80 and pal.v80 are accepted, and the accept path NAMES the revision
       - every other revision is refused CLEANLY (exit 1, no crash trace, no
         renderer bring-up) and the message names that revision AND the revisions
         this build does support. "Clean" matters: an earlier version of this check
         accepted any non-zero exit, so a build whose revision gate was broken
         still passed -- it accepted the ROM, SIGSEGV'd in asset_swap_lut, and the
         signal exit read as a refusal.
  2. A non-DKR N64 ROM is refused and said to be non-DKR. Synthesised at runtime
     from the supported ROM by rewriting the cart id and title, then deleted.
  3. BYTE ORDER: a synthesised .v64 and .n64 boot and race BYTE-IDENTICALLY to the
     .z64 -- same frame set, same frame hashes, same racer trajectory. Synthesised
     at runtime under a git-ignored path and deleted afterwards.
  4. BOTH SIDES AGREE: dist/web/rom-id.js is the browser mirror of
     platform/rom_id.c. Their revision TABLES are parsed and compared row by row,
     and (when node is available) the JS is run over each real ROM and its verdict
     string must match the native binary's, character for character. Without this
     the "mirrors rom_io.c" comment is just a claim that rots.
  5. Every supported revision other than us.v80 drives the same trajectory over
     the same race and selects its authored source-video standard. PAL rendering
     is not required to be byte-identical to NTSC: the game intentionally uses
     osTvType for region-specific presentation and timing.

A note on how this check was made honest
----------------------------------------
An earlier revision compared only the INTERSECTION of the two frame sets. A run
that died after one (black) frame therefore "matched" its healthy counterpart:
the deliberately-corrupted positive control reported "1/1 identical, 0 differ"
while the process had actually SIGSEGV'd. A differing frame COUNT is now a
failure in its own right, and every comparison asserts a minimum frame count, so
a crash can never read as agreement.

Verified in both directions -- see docs/ROM_REVISIONS.md for the pasted output of
each. With rom_id.c's revision check reverted, assertions 1 and 2 fail (every
revision is accepted); with dkr_rom_normalize_byte_order()'s two swap loops
removed, assertion 3 fails on the frame COUNT (the .v64/.n64 runs die early).

Usage:
    tests/check_rom_revision.py [--build build] [--rom baserom.us.v80.z64]
                                [--roms build/roms] [--frames 4300] [-v]

Always runs muted + headless (MDKR_AUDIO=0 and --headless-frames), per
tests/README.md. Exit 0 = pass; exit 1 = at least one assertion failed.
