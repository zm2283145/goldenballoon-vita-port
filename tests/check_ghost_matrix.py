"""Record a Time Trial ghost and read it back in a FRESH process, per legal pair.

Why this exists
---------------
`tests/check_race_finish_time.py` is the only gate that has ever exercised
`timetrial_ghost_read()`, and it drives exactly ONE of the 47 legal
(track, vehicle) combinations: Ancient Lake in the car. That single row is how
the 3-vs-4 Catmull-Rom control-point overflow was found at all, and it was found
by accident -- the fixture happened to re-enter the level after the finish, which
is the only thing that plays a recorded ghost back. The abort it produced was
SIGABRT out of `__stack_chk_fail` with **nothing at all on stderr**: no
`[CRASH]`, no `[FATAL]`, no sanitizer line. A check that greps for crash markers
cannot see that class of failure; only the exit code and the presence of the
markers a *successful* run must emit can.

Ghosts are also the one piece of player data that persists keyed by the PAIR
rather than by the track. `func_80074B34()` / `func_80075000()` (game/src/save_data.c)
both match a Controller Pak ghost slot on `levelId` **and** `vehicleId`:

    if ((levelId == ghostDataBody[i].unk0) && (vehicleId == ghostDataBody[i].unk1)) {

so "Ancient Lake in a car round-trips" says nothing about the other 46 rows. This
check closes that gap: every legal pair records a ghost, saves it, and a
**separate process** loads it back and plays it.

The three runs per pair
-----------------------
Each pair gets its own `MDKR_SAVE_DIR`, so no pair can see another's EEPROM or
Controller Pak, and the 6-slot pak ghost directory (`DKR_GHOST_SLOT_COUNT`,
save_data.c) is never contended -- 47 ghosts do not fit on one pak. The
contended case is owned by tests/check_ghost_bank_capacity.py, which drives
more pairs than the window holds against ONE shared save directory and gates
platform/ghost_bank.c's window swapping (issue #46); this check stays about
per-pair round-tripping.

  1. **measure** -- drive the Time Trial to the finish with plain A taps and read
     the frame at which the post-race OPTIONS stage opens offering SAVE GHOST.
     A three-lap finish lands anywhere from ~7500 (Ancient Lake, car) to ~12500
     (DarkMoon Caverns, car) frames depending on the pair, so a fixed input
     script cannot aim at a menu row across 47 rows; the `[TTGHOST] event=options`
     probe (game/src/menu.c) is what makes the aim a measurement. This run also
     carries the **in-process** coverage: its trailing A taps pick TRY AGAIN,
     re-entering the level and playing back the ghost just recorded, which is the
     original overflow route.
  2. **write** -- from a fresh save directory, re-drive the identical
     (deterministic) race and steer the measured menu onto SAVE GHOST, which is
     the only route to `timetrial_save_player_ghost()`. Asserts
     `[TTGHOST] event=save ... status=0` with a non-empty node count, and that
     the Controller Pak image appeared on disk.
  3. **read** -- a FRESH process against that same save directory. On level entry
     `timetrial_init_player_ghost()` pulls the ghost back off the pak; the check
     asserts `[TTGHOST] event=load` reports the SAME pair, the SAME node count,
     character and time that were written, and that ghost playback actually ran
     from a player bank.

What "silent abort" means for the assertions
--------------------------------------------
Every run asserts the exit code AND that the markers a healthy run emits are
present -- the traced finish, the options probe, the save/load rows. "No crash
marker appeared" is never sufficient, because the defect class this exists for
produces no marker.

Pacing, and one documented non-producer
---------------------------------------
Whether the autopilot completes a lap at all is pacing-dependent in BOTH
directions -- neither simulation cadence laps the whole matrix (see CADENCE_ARMS
for the four measured rows). So each pair is driven on the first cadence that
gets it round, and the run reports which one; pinning a single pacing would
silently cost coverage, and on Enhanced alone Frosty Village -- a
hovercraft-only track -- has nothing that can lap it.

Spaceport Alpha (15) **in the car** completes no lap on either cadence: its
autopilot racing line dead-ends at `courseCheckpoint` 10, and DKR only records a
ghost for a course time under 10800 frames (`objects.c`
race_finish_time_trial). The pair is legal -- the ROM's `available_vehicles`
mask offers the car -- so it is not skipped: it is asserted to behave exactly
that way, and the check fails if it ever starts finishing (meaning it can be
promoted) or if it starts aborting.

Usage:
    tests/check_ghost_matrix.py                  # all 47 legal pairs
    tests/check_ghost_matrix.py --subset         # one row per track and vehicle
    tests/check_ghost_matrix.py --pairs 5:0,15:2
    tests/check_ghost_matrix.py --matrix         # print the matrix and exit

Always runs muted + headless (MDKR_AUDIO=0 and --headless-frames), per
tests/README.md. Exit 0 = every pair round-tripped its ghost.
