"""Render purity: skipping renders must not change authoritative state.

After the render-purity migrations, rendering is required to be pure: a
schedule that skips half of
all scene renders (`MDKR_TEST_SKIP_RENDER=odd`) must produce a byte-identical
per-tick `[SIMHASH]` stream.

Arms:

* **A — raw purity (the assertion):** normal vs skip-odd streams must be
  BYTE-IDENTICAL over the full route. There is no test-only state subtraction.
* **B — positive control:** `MDKR_TEST_RENDER_IMPURITY=1` injects one
  authoritative RNG write inside every non-skipped render; normal vs skip-odd
  must DIVERGE, proving the gate can see an actual render leak.
* **C — zero-delta replay, authoritative (Phase 3 Wave B slice 1):** with
  With the versioned internal test token and `MDKR_TEST_REPLAY_WALK=1`, every
  tick's display list is walked a SECOND time
  through the HLE, with the frozen matrix registry restored and the same
  view-projection. The `[SIMHASH]` stream must stay byte-identical to arm A's:
  drawing the frame twice is not allowed to move one authoritative bit.
* **D — zero-delta replay, pixels:** the same replay must also overdraw the
  frame IDENTICALLY. Dumped frames are compared byte-for-byte against a
  non-replay run of the same route. Arm D is the one that can see a replay
  which renders *nearly* the same thing; arm C cannot.
* **E — recomposition control (the path slice 2 actually uses):** with
  With that token and `MDKR_TEST_REPLAY_WALK=recompose`, every gameplay-camera
  matrix is forced
  through the `world x view_projection` recomposition, still with the camera
  unchanged. Authoritative state and pixels must again be untouched. This arm
  exists because arms C/D alone never exercise the recomposition — a replay
  that overrides nothing has nothing to rebuild — so without it slice 2 would
  be building on an unproven path.

Arms C/D history: their first runs failed at ~8k of 307k pixels, over 7k of
them off by exactly 1. Root cause was not the matrix path but the caster frame:
gfx_end_frame commits this tick's shadow casters and swaps the read index
before the replay runs, so the replay was lighting the scene with a shadow map
one tick ahead of the geometry casting it.

Arm E's first run found the second real defect: 5178 of 35119 gameplay matrices
did not recompose back to the display list they came from, the worst by ~2320
world units, because not every registration site's decomposition is the exact
association the list was built with. The replay now verifies each decomposition
against the list before trusting it with a different camera, and falls back to
the list's own matrix when it does not hold.

That verification is bit-exact HERE and a geometric distance on the interpolated
path, and arm E is what keeps the two apart. Arm E forces recomposition with the
camera UNCHANGED, so the display list already holds the exact matrix and the
only thing a tolerance could buy is a precision loss against the identical-
overdraw assertion below. The `mtxtol == 0` check states that separation as an
assertion instead of leaving it to the pixels to notice.

History note: arm A's first ever runs failed and root-caused three real
defects — the skydome object's camera-follow write (hash-visible live
object), and two 1-ULP add/subtract restore pairs on racers (tumble y,
carBob xyz). This gate exists precisely to keep finding that class.

Coverage ceiling
----------------

* The purity hash is v3: globals/progression, object and particle integrators,
  racer internals, behavior properties, interactions, model animation state,
  and the former render-owned opacity/LOD/distance fields. Each family has an
  independent positive control in `check_state_hash.py`.
* **Arm E's ceiling.** `mtxhit != 0` proves the recomposition ran, not that it
  is still working; see the reject-ratio assertion below for why that needed a
  second bound and what it is set to.

Always muted + headless. Exit 0 = pass.
