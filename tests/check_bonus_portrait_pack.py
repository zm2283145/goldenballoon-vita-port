"""A content pack replaces the generated Taj, Wizpig and Terry portraits.

Why this exists
---------------
The three bonus racers have no retail portrait, so the port draws theirs from
code: `taj_portrait_texture()`, `wizpig_portrait_texture()` and
`terry_portrait_texture()` in game/src/menu.c compose 40x40 RGBA cards out of
rectangles and ellipses. The project cannot ship art resembling Rare's, so a
player who wants a different Taj has exactly one route -- a content pack.

That route already works, and this gate is the thing that says so out loud and
keeps it true. A generated portrait is an ORDINARY texture bind: menu.c hands
its texels to the display list like any material, `dkr_bind_tile()` keys them
the way it keys a ROM tile, and the override layer in front of the ROM path
(platform/fast3d/gfx_pc_dkr.c) neither knows nor cares where the pixels came
from. So the published digest contract in platform/mod_texture_key.h covers
these cards with no second scheme, no version bump and no producer-side seam:
the digest is taken over the generated RGBA bytes plus the same header fields
it takes over a ROM texture's, because they arrive at the same function.

What is easy to lose, and what this file is really guarding
-----------------------------------------------------------
A ROM texture's digest is frozen for all time -- the ROM does not change. A
GENERATED portrait's digest is a function of OUR code. Move one ellipse in
menu.c and the name changes, and every pack in the wild that addressed the old
name goes quietly inert: no crash, no log line, no failing test. The player
sees the stock portrait and has no way to tell a broken pack from a pack they
installed wrong.

So the three digests below are pinned deliberately. If this gate fails on the
digest, the procedural art moved, and that is a decision to make on purpose --
retouch the art and republish the digests in docs/MODDING.md, or leave the art
alone. It must not be a side effect noticed by a modder six months later.

The route
---------
`tests/input_scripts/race_full_3lap_tt.txt` to frame 7700 -- the same real
post-race flow, the same capture frame and the same result-card anchor
`check_bonus_results_portraits.py` already uses, so the region sampled here is
a region another gate independently proves holds a portrait. Each character is
put in player 0 by its own bootstrap variable (`MDKR_TAJ_TEST_PLAYER` and its
two siblings). Seven runs, each in its own throwaway working directory, which
is also where that arm's `mods/` and dumped corpus live:

    baseline          Taj, no `mods/` at all, MDKR_MOD_TEXTURE_DUMP on
    taj               Taj, one pack overriding the pinned Taj digest
    wizpig            Wizpig, the same at the pinned Wizpig digest
    terry             Terry, the same at the pinned Terry digest
    disabled          the identical pack with `enabled = 0` in its pack.ini
    webgpu-baseline   the baseline arm again on the shipped default backend
    webgpu-taj        the taj arm again on the shipped default backend

The last two are not decoration. WebGPU is what ships, and a digest measured
only on GL would be a name published from a renderer most players never run.
The digest excludes everything renderer-chosen BY CONSTRUCTION -- the allocation
address, row addressing, mips, the font atlas -- so the three names should be
backend-independent; "should be" is what these arms convert into an observation.
They were also measured by hand across both backends before being written: all
three digests are byte-identical on GL and WebGPU, which is why docs/MODDING.md
publishes one table and not two.

Frames are NOT compared across backends anywhere here. Two rasterizers need not
produce the same bytes and nothing in this file claims they do; the byte-identity
assertion (5) stays within GL.

The pack image is `quadrant_png()` imported from check_mod_texture_override.py
-- the same synthetic magenta-corner-on-green PNG that gate authors for itself,
at 64x64 here. Deliberately NOT a solid colour, and deliberately larger than
the 40x40 card. A solid replacement cannot witness texture ADDRESSING: every
sub-window of solid magenta is solid magenta, which is exactly how the
corner-sampling defect behind issue #34 stayed invisible to that gate's earlier
form. The quadrant makes the two outcomes unmistakable on a portrait too --
correct logical addressing shows the whole card the whole image, green three to
one; corner addressing shows it magenta.

No ROM bytes and no game art reach the repository: the pack pixels are two
constants this file's neighbour names, every run works in a temporary
directory, and the dumped corpus is read for filenames only.

What is asserted
----------------
 1. REACHABILITY, AND NOTHING VACUOUS. Every run exits 0 with no runtime
    diagnostic, and player 0 owns THIS character's result card
    (`bonus_results_portrait: player=0 identity=<n>`) composed at 40x40. The
    ownership line is what makes the arm character-specific: the results screen
    composes all three cards on every run, so "a card was composed" is true in
    every arm and would assert nothing. The three pack arms report their pack
    active; the disabled arm reports it skipped WITH the pack.ini reason; the
    baseline arm reports no pack at all.

 2. THE DUMP PUBLISHES THE PORTRAIT DIGEST. The baseline arm's
    MDKR_MOD_TEXTURE_DUMP corpus contains `<TAJ_DIGEST>.png` and a sidecar
    saying 40x40 -- so a pack author following the "Finding a digest" recipe in
    docs/MODDING.md finds these cards there like any other texture, rather than
    having to be told a constant. When it is absent the failure NAMES every
    40x40 digest the route did dump, because the overwhelmingly likely cause is
    that the procedural art changed and this is the new name.

 3. A PACK DRAWS THE PORTRAIT. In each pack arm the whole card region is the
    pack's own two colours -- coverage at least 99.5% -- and green-dominant
    between 60% and 85% of it, which is the quadrant seen whole. Green-family
    is the witness rather than magenta because Taj's own purple turban reads
    magenta-family (measured: 23% of the stock card), while green-family is
    exactly 0 in all three stock cards including Terry's, whose teal has too
    much blue to qualify.

 4. AND ONLY THE PORTRAIT. A region of the same results screen beside the card
    carries zero pack pixels in every arm. Without this, "the card is the pack"
    would also be satisfied by a build that replaced the entire frame.

 5. TURNING THE PACK OFF RESTORES THE GENERATED CARD, EXACTLY. The disabled
    arm's frame is BYTE-IDENTICAL to the no-pack baseline's. Byte-identical is
    the whole assertion: a merely "different" frame would also be produced by a
    pack that half-applied. This is the no-pack guarantee -- an install with no
    pack renders what it rendered before packs existed.

 6. AND ALL OF IT HOLDS ON THE RENDERER THAT SHIPS. On WebGPU the corpus
    publishes the SAME Taj digest (assertion 2 again, so the published name is
    not a GL artifact) and a pack at that name draws the card (assertion 3
    again). Every arm additionally proves it got the backend it asked for, so
    an adapter that quietly fell back to GL cannot pass as WebGPU evidence.

Self-validation -- this check is proven to be able to fail
-----------------------------------------------------------
Both positive controls below were run by hand against this build, not by this
file, and both are the SAME defect seen from its two ends: the pinned name and
the picture it names having drifted apart.

CONTROL 1, the pin is wrong. Change the last digit of TAJ_DIGEST below and
re-run. Assertion 2 fires first -- before any pack arm, because the baseline
arm runs first -- and it self-diagnoses, naming the digest the art actually
produces:

    check_bonus_portrait_pack: FAIL -- baseline: MDKR_MOD_TEXTURE_DUMP did not
    publish 7757ffb6d3f809fbde246ca559d51eb5. The generated portrait art has
    almost certainly changed, which renames it and silently breaks every pack
    that addressed the old name. 40x40 digests this route did dump:
    ['7757ffb6d3f809fbde246ca559d51eb4']

CONTROL 2, the art is what moved -- the failure this gate exists for. Change
ONE channel of ONE pixel of Taj's card in game/src/menu.c (measured on
`taj_portrait_pixel(16, 4, ...)`, 96 -> 97 in the blue channel: a change no
player could see) and rebuild. The card's digest becomes
8a107fd16aef96b359e2469454aa23cb, every pack addressing the old name goes
inert, and assertion 2 fails with that new name in hand. Nothing else in the
suite notices: the art still draws, the portrait gates still pass, and without
this assertion the break would surface as a modder's bug report.

Always muted and headless (`MDKR_AUDIO=0`, `--headless-frames`), per
tests/README.md. `MDKR_AUDIO=off` would be a silent no-op -- only the digit `0`
disables. Exit 0 = pass.
