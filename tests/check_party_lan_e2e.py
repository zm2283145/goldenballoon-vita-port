"""End-to-end zero-internet Phone Party: native host + real browser, NO cloud.

This is the crown gate for local-only play. Every other LAN gate stubs a leg:
the transport test fakes the phone socket, the room/server tests never open a
browser, and the page unit tests reach only the controller's pure seams. This
lane runs the WHOLE no-internet triangle for real and with NO wrangler worker
anywhere in it:

* the packaged native host model (``mdkr_native_party_e2e_driver --lan``) whose
  MdkrLanPartyTransport OWNS the embedded MdkrLanPartyServer + in-process
  MdkrLanPartyRoom -- the signaling backend is in-process, not a cloud Worker;
* a headless Chromium controller that loads ``/controller/#<capability>`` from
  THAT embedded server over plain ``http`` (an insecure origin), redeems over
  its ``/party-ws``, and pairs with the pure-JS SAS fallback;
* real libdatachannel WebRTC with real DTLS fingerprints between the two.

GUARANTEEING THE JS SAS FALLBACK IS WHAT RUNS (or the crown assertion is
hollow). The pairing phrase is only a cross-proof of the pure-JS SHA-256 + P-256
twin against the native mbedtls crypto if the page could not have used
``crypto.subtle``. The browser exposes ``crypto.subtle`` on a *secure* context,
and a loopback origin (``127.0.0.1``) is a secure context by the browser's own
rules -- so serving on loopback would silently let the page use the vetted
engine crypto and make the phrase match prove nothing. This lane forces the
insecure path two ways and asserts it in the live page before it will accept a
phrase:

* PRIMARY (``lan-ip``): serve the page from a real non-loopback private IPv4
  (the same enumeration the server freezes into its Host allowlist). The
  browser reports ``isSecureContext === false`` and does NOT expose
  ``crypto.subtle`` -- genuinely, with zero page spoofing.
* FALLBACK (``loopback-forced``): only when the host has no private LAN IPv4
  (e.g. a CI box with loopback alone), serve on ``127.0.0.1`` and install a
  boot hook that makes ``isSecureContext`` report false and ``crypto.subtle``
  undefined, reproducing the identical insecure-origin conditions.

Either way ``assert_js_fallback`` pins, IN THE RUNNING PAGE, that
``isSecureContext === false``, ``crypto.subtle === undefined``, and the
pure-JS ``MDKRPartySas.fallback`` is present. ``getSubtle()`` in party-sas.js is
read at call time, so with subtle absent the JS twin is the ONLY code that can
have produced the words the page renders. Their equality with the native phrase
is therefore an end-to-end cross-proof of the two crypto implementations.

Scenarios, each with its own PASS line:

* ``golden_path`` -- browser loads over http from the embedded server, redeems
  the minted capability over ws, the native mbedtls phrase EQUALS the page's
  pure-JS phrase (the crown), and non-neutral pad packets cross the real
  ingress.
* ``code_path`` -- a WRONG six-digit code is refused, then the right code pairs
  through to Connected with matching phrases and input flow.
* ``throttle`` -- 13 rapid wrong codes trip the room's shared code bucket and
  the phone shows the typed "Too many code attempts" refusal.
* ``stop`` -- the host closes the room; the phone, re-redeeming over the
  still-served ws, learns and shows ``host_closed``.
