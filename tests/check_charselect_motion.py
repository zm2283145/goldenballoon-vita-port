"""Prove the character-select dancers are actually dancing -- and stay that way.

Why this exists
----------------
A user once reported the character-select dancers were static. The report was
disproven by ad-hoc analysis with `tools/anim_period.py`: byte-identical
captures across 86 commits, whole-screen motion RMS ~14.1, dominant
autocorrelation period ~19-20 frames (`peak_r` ~0.66) -- clearly moving, and
clearly periodic. But that analysis was run by hand once. There was, and until
this file existed still is, ZERO automated coverage: a real regression in
`obj_loop_char_select()` (`game/src/object_functions.c`) or in the
`music_animation_fraction()` clock it reads (`platform/stubs_dkr.c`) would ship
completely undetected. This productizes that analysis into a permanent gate.

Why whole-screen RMS, not a per-character crop
------------------------------------------------
The legacy rate check measured a cropped "two character rows" region
(0.1,0.2,0.95,0.65) to catch the T1 bug where the dance ran 8x too fast. That
crop also catches butterflies drifting across the screen: on this capture its
autocorrelation peaks at lag 9 (r=0.74), not the dancers' true ~19-20 frame
cycle, because the butterflies have their own faster rhythm. Measuring the
WHOLE frame instead reproduces the original ad-hoc numbers almost exactly
(14.285 vs 14.120 RMS, lag 19 vs "period 20", on a capture starting 50 frames
later than the original run) and lets this one gate reject both frozen dancers
and the original too-fast period.

Whole-screen RMS still has to prove it can catch a dancer-specific freeze, not
just a fully-dead screen (a bug could plausibly freeze only the character
models while the background/butterflies keep moving). Measured directly:
freezing only the legacy dancer crop (dancers held at their frame-0
pose, everything else including butterflies left alone) drops per-window
(24-frame) whole-screen motion from a real 5.76-6.90 down to 4.24-4.65 -- a
clean, consistent gap below the MIN_WINDOW_MOTION floor chosen here. A full
freeze (below) drops it to exactly 0. So the floor is set with margin against
BOTH failure shapes, and the shipped broken-direction control below exercises
the stronger (full-freeze) one, per the plan's own suggested construction.

The six-window ensemble
------------------------
Reused directly from `check_mip_motion.py`: a single window's motion swings
with capture phase (see that file's WINDOW_FRAMES/WINDOW_COUNT comment), so
one window characterises a frame choice, not the animation. This gate captures
the same CAPTURE_COUNT = WINDOW_FRAMES * WINDOW_COUNT = 144 frames, scores each
24-frame window independently with `tools/anim_period.py`'s own
`autocorrelation()` helper, and asserts the ensemble: mean motion RMS >= floor
AND at least 5/6 windows individually clear a per-window floor. Measured on two
different capture offsets (CAPTURE_FROM 1650 and 1710, i.e. different dance
phase at the first frame), every real window landed in 5.76-6.90 and every
ensemble mean in 6.4-6.7 -- comfortably above both floors with room to spare
before the dancer-freeze ceiling of 4.65.

Periodicity is asserted too, but loosely, per the instruction not to overfit a
flaky measurement: the full 144-frame capture's autocorrelation peak must land
in a generous [14, 26]-frame band with r >= 0.3. Measured real values: lag 19,
r=0.66 (offset 1650) and lag 19, r=0.66 (offset 1710) -- stable across phase,
so the band has real margin without being tuned to the exact ROM value.

Broken-direction controls (required)
------------------------------------
No env-gated animation-freeze hook exists anywhere in the game/engine sources
(searched `obj_loop_char_select`, `music_animation_fraction`, and every
FREEZE-named symbol in the tree -- the only FREEZE hits are DPC/RDP bus flags
and an unrelated matrix-registry perf counter). Adding one would be new game
code for a test-only need, which the plan explicitly asks to avoid when an
analyzer-level control will do. It will: the ensemble scorer above is a pure
function of a list of luma grids, so a frozen-frame arm is built by taking the
SAME captured grids and replacing every one of them with a copy of the first
frame -- literally the "capture where every frame is duplicated from frame 0"
construction the plan calls out. A second arm loops five phases sampled across
one healthy cycle, recreating the original roughly five-frame too-fast failure
shape. Both arms run through the identical scoring function used for the real
capture, and the check's own PASS depends on both failing: the frozen arm must
trip the motion floors, while the fast-loop arm must fail the [14, 26]-frame
period band.
