"""Freeze the legacy all-racer state/RNG stream for the authored 30 Hz route.

This is a raw compatibility oracle, not a statistical gameplay gate. It
protects every emitted racer row and the shared authored RNG value against the
accepted vehicle-audio/Taj integration baseline. The prior hash predated the
ordinary-car audio dispatch and therefore froze a port bug: the retail ROM's
``racer_sound_car`` consumes the shared RNG stream. That ownership was proved
directly with the pinned ares PC/return-address witness documented in
tests/README.md before this oracle was rebaselined. The fixture is encoded as a
row count, exact schema, and SHA-256 so no private ROM-derived log is shipped.
The shared route compiler advances native script entries by one fixed ticket,
matching the host input boundary's N-to-N+1 publication contract; this keeps
the exact accepted stream stable instead of rebaselining around test timing.

REBASELINE 2026-08-05 (d74efe02 -> 53c8ca2c). The superseded hash froze a
second port defect, in the same shape as the first: 670c984 corrected the
8th-place racing-line selector in func_80042D20(). racePosition is 1-indexed
(1..8) and D_800DCDA0 holds eight entries, so 8th place reads index 8, one past
the end. The port had clamped that to D_800DCDA0[7] == 2, a value the retail
game never produces; on hardware the read lands in the adjacent table and
yields D_800DCDA8[0] == 1.

That is not an argument from the disassembly's symbol names -- it is checked
against the shipped ROM on every run by check_racing_line_overrun_witness()
below, which locates the two tables by content and asserts their adjacency and
the overrun byte. The pin moved only after the ROM said which side was right,
and only after a build of this tree carrying nothing but the pre-670c984 clamp
reproduced d74efe02 exactly -- proving that single selector, and nothing else
in the 52 commits since the old pin (the bounded/extent-carrying inflate path,
the game-text terminator count, the texture-header handling, or the camera
obstruction port), accounts for the difference.

REBASELINE 2026-09-01 (53c8ca2c -> 191bee35). The crossplay campaign pinned
-ffp-contract=off across every engine lane (84b89c7d): with no flag set each
toolchain chose its own FMA fusion, so gameplay float state was not
bit-reproducible across native/wasm/mingw. The pin changes which float
roundings the compiled sim performs -- 84b89c7d measured 59 of 225 engine TUs
changing bytes, racer.c/collision.c/camera.c/particles.c among them, i.e. the
authoritative racer trajectory this oracle records -- so the raw ORACLE stream
reaches a different (still fully deterministic) sequence. The digest is neither
the old pin nor SUPERSEDED_SHA256, so the racing-line clamp is unaffected; the
row count and every field schema are unchanged, only the values drift. The
online direct-boot golden was re-minted for exactly this codegen change in the
same campaign (d6bbad62, hashVisible=hashPeer=db805fd2), but this offline oracle
was not re-frozen alongside it -- that omission is the whole delta. The trig
tables baked from the vendored .s in the same campaign (9fe5bbf5) are
hash-neutral (byte-identical to the load-time libm generation this tree
measured), and the sim_hash.c file sink (b624b584/b1064204) is I/O-only: it
mirrors the identical [SIMHASH] line to MDKR_STATE_HASH_FILE, which this lane
never sets, and never touches the hash or the sim. Measured on a fresh Release
build at 21b0519d carrying the pin (-ffp-contract=off in 225 TUs).
