 * LAYOUT (split-array class). gActiveCameraID reaches 4 — viewport_reset() sets it
 * to 4 by hand — and both viewport_reset() and viewport_rsp_set() then read
 * `gScreenViewports[gActiveCameraID].flags`. The array is declared [4], so that is
 * an out-of-bounds read of whatever the linker parked after it. UBSan
 * -fsanitize=array-bounds reports it on EVERY route this project has
 * (camera.c:1005 and camera.c:1027 pre-fix, 99 of 99 runs in the sweep).
 *
 * What it actually reads today, on all three targets, is gViewportStack[2]:
 *
 *   target   &gScreenViewports  +256 lands on          bit 0 of that halfword
 *   N64      0x800DD068         gViewportStack[2]      vscale[1] = halfHeight*4

 *   wasm32   0x00019840         gViewportStack[2]      vscale[0] = tempWidth*4
 *
 * VIEWPORT_EXTRA_BG is 0x0001 and viewport_rsp_set() only ever stores multiples of
 * 4 into vscale, so the aliased halfword's bit 0 is always 0 and the read always
 * yields "no extra background". That is why this has been silent: it is benign by
 * arithmetic accident, not by design, and it is one relink away from flipping
 * viewport_reset() and viewport_rsp_set() onto the wrong branch for the
 * full-screen camera.
 *
 * Give index 4 a real element. This is provably behaviour-identical: every write
 * path (camEnableUserView / camDisableUserView / viewport_menu_set, all called
 * with index 0, plus copy_viewports_to_stack(), which loops i < 4) uses viewport
 * index 0..3, so element 4 keeps its initialiser forever, and DEFAULT_VIEWPORT's
 * flags field is 0 — exactly what the out-of-bounds read returns. It also makes
 * the (currently unreachable) scissor read at camera.c:665 return sane defaults
 * instead of gViewportStack bytes.
 *
 * Detector: tests/check_array_bounds_sweep.py fails if this goes back out of
 * bounds (verified — reverting this block makes it report
