 * LAYOUT: on the N64 these two symbols are ONE contiguous 26-entry table, and
 * waves.c depends on that rather than merely benefiting from it.
 * waves_visibility() sentinel-clears all 26 slots — `D_8012A5E8[0..1]` *and*
 * `D_8012A600[0..23]`, spelled out as its own reset loop — and then appends every
 * visible wave block through `D_8012A5E8[var_a3]`, with var_a3 measured up to 25
 * (Whale Bay, level 8/19). That is, it indexes D_8012A5E8 straight on into
 * D_8012A600. func_800B92F4() and func_800B97A8() then walk
 * `for (k = 0; D_8012A5E8[k].blockID != -1; k++)` over the same 26 slots.
 *
 * As two separate C objects that only holds if the linker happens to place them
 * adjacently, and whether it does is luck:
 *
 *   Mach-O/arm64 starts D_8012A5E8 at an address 8 mod 16, so its 24 bytes end
 *   16-byte aligned and the 288-byte D_8012A600 (which LLVM gives a 16-byte
 *   preferred alignment) needs no padding — exactly adjacent, so it works.
 *
 *   wasm-ld starts D_8012A5E8 *at* 16-byte alignment, so its 24 bytes end at
 *   8 mod 16 and D_8012A600 is padded up: an 8-BYTE HOLE. Slots 2..25 then land
 *   8 bytes BELOW the slots the reset loop cleared, so the `blockID != -1` walk
 *   never reliably terminates, k runs past the table, and func_800B92F4()'s
 *   `D_800E3178[D_8012A5E8[k].unk8]` loads through a garbage index — the
 *   "memory access out of bounds" a player hit in the browser build.
 *
 * Measured in the exact wasm that crashed (source 63c5d32): &D_8012A5E8 = 231504,
 * so &D_8012A5E8[2] = 231528, but &D_8012A600 = 231536. Natively the two are 24
 * bytes apart, i.e. the gap is 0, which is why this was invisible on the native
 * target and in the whole regression suite.
 *
 * Back both names onto one 26-entry array so the contiguity the code relies on is
 * guaranteed by the language instead of by the linker, on every target. This also
 * removes the UB: `D_8012A5E8[0..25]` is now in bounds of a real 26-element array
 * (UBSan -fsanitize=array-bounds flagged indices 2 and 3 here before). D_8012A600
 * stays a 24-element array, so ARRAY_COUNT(D_8012A600) in the reset loop is
 * unchanged. Nothing outside this file references either symbol.

 * ---- the wave surface's presentation identity ---------------------------
 *
 * WHAT WAS MISSING. waves_render() emitted every tile through ONE stack-local
 * ObjectTransform. The snapshot's capture walk enumerates gObjPtrList, so a
 * stack local is invisible to it: no snapshot entry, no presentation owner,
 * and an interpolated present replayed the water's tick-T matrix under a
 * tick-T+alpha camera. The UV side of the same surface was already handled
 * (gfx_dkr_note_paired_triangle_buffers, waves_alloc), which is the worst of
 * both: a texture gliding over geometry stepping at 30 Hz. This is residual
 * obligation 0 in docs/architecture/presentation-interpolation.md.
 *
 * ONE SLOT PER TILE, NOT PER SUB-QUAD. A double-density tile draws four
 * sub-quads from four different offsets of the same origin. They still share
 * a slot, because the owner's residual (`source_position` minus the pose the
 * snapshot captured) already carries a render-time offset exactly like the
 * racer tumble and bob it was built for -- and here it carries it EXACTLY,
 * because a wave tile's captured pose is constant, so the reconstructed
 * transform is the pushed one to the bit. Four slots per tile would cost 104
 * registry entries to reproduce a number the residual already reproduces.
 *
 * BOUNDED BY THE VISIBILITY TABLE. One slot per entry the 26-slot table can
 * hold, normally claimed and retired at TICK time: registration issues a fresh
 * generation, and reissuing one every frame would leave the tile permanently
 * discontinuous. If drawless catch-up moves the camera far enough to reveal a
 * new tile, waves_owner_transform() claims it at the draw boundary and lets the
 * fresh generation snap once instead of emitting ownerless geometry.

/**
 * Fidelity Phase 2b (P0) -- authoritative half of waves_update.
 *
 * Census: docs/RENDER_MUTATION_CENSUS_2026-07-29.md, "Scene-tree deep census"
 * P0. `waves_update` used to run entirely inside `render_scene` (tracks.c:410),
 * yet three of the things it advances are read back by PHYSICS, not by the
 * renderer:
 *
 *   - gWaveHeightIndices[].s[0]/[1] -- the per-tile wave phase, sampled by
 *     get_level_segment_waves -> func_800BB2F4 into racer->buoyancy
 *     (racer.c:2146-2148, 4612-4613) and object Y placement
 *     (object_functions.c:5751/5791 via obj_wave_height);
 *   - gWaveGenList[].unk1A via func_800BFE98 (waves.c:2784), same readers;
 *   - gWaveController.magnitude / gWavePowerDivisor, the global wave strength
 *     those same queries scale by.
 *
 * Under high-rate presentation (N renders per authoritative tick) the render
 * path would advance the water phase N times per tick and racers would bob at
 * the frame rate. So the phase advance lives here, called once per tick from
 * thread3_main.c immediately before render_scene, under the same
 * `if (gWaveBlockCount)` guard and the same `is_game_paused() -> rate 0` gate
 * render_scene applied.
 *
 * What deliberately does NOT move (see the census's flip-parity rule):
 *   - gWaveVertexFlip (waves.c:872) is a per-RENDER double-buffer parity and is
 *     not idempotent -- it must stay render-side;
 *   - the tex-frame / UV-base advance and the UV table + triangle rebuild are
 *     presentation state with no gameplay reader (class 2). They stay in
 *     waves_update for now, consuming the unchanged tempUpdateRate, which keeps
 *     this diff behaviour-identical under the one-render-per-tick containment
 *     loop. They are a later migration.
 *
 * Under containment (exactly one render_scene per tick) this is a pure code
 * motion: the same writes happen the same number of times in the same order
 * relative to every reader.

     * NATIVE_PORT: this one allocation is carved into four arrays, and both the

     * segments is, in order:
     *
     *     gWaveGenList   32 * sizeof(WaveGen)   = 0x800 on every platform
     *     gWaveGenObjs   32 * sizeof(Object *)  = 0x80 on N64, 0x100 on LP64
     *     D_800E3184     gWaveTileGridCount * sizeof(unk800E3184)
     *
     * The original tail constant 0x880 is exactly 0x800 + 32 * 4, so it is only
     * correct where pointers are four bytes. Worse, the offset that finds
     * gWaveGenObjs -- `gWaveGenList + sizeof(WaveGen *) * 8` -- is pointer
     * arithmetic on WaveGen *, i.e. it advances (sizeof(WaveGen *) * 8) WHOLE
     * WaveGen structs. On N64 that is 4 * 8 = 32 structs = 0x800, landing
     * exactly right; on LP64 it is 8 * 8 = 64 structs = 0x1000, which overshoots
     * by 0x800 and lands inside (or past) D_800E3184's bucket table.
     *
     * Measured before this fix, on levels 19 and 34: gWaveGenObjs sat 0x1000
     * after gWaveGenList, its 32 "slots" read back as 0xFF-filled bucket bytes
     * rather than NULL, wavegen_register never found a free slot,
     * gWaveGenCount stayed 0, and waves_get_y returned before touching a single
     * generator -- so no swell has ever rendered in the native port. The zeroing
     * loop below was simultaneously writing 32 pointers of zeroes over
     * D_800E3184's 0xFF sentinels, corrupting the very table the register walk
     * scans.
     *
     * Note this is native-only. wasm32 pointers are four bytes, so the original
     * expression carves correctly there exactly as it does on N64 -- which is
     * why the swell system has always been live in the browser build, and why
     * the byte-swapped generator values (see BHV_WAVE_GENERATOR in objects.c)
     * were visible to players there and nowhere else.
     *
     * The fix is to say what was meant: 32 WaveGen structs, and a tail sized
     * from the host's real pointer width. The original expression is kept for
     * the N64 build, where it is correct.
