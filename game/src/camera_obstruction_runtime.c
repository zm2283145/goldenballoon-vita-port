 * Release hysteresis on retraction (docs/architecture/camera-obstruction.md
 * section 7.3). Contact retracts the boom on the tick it is seen -- retract
 * latency stays 0 -- but a clear corridor does NOT start recovery until it has
 * been clear this many consecutive authored ticks.
 *
 * The value comes from the MOTION-01 traces, not from taste. On the 3P + T.T.
 * spectate route the corridor sweep drops out against a wall it is still
 * pressed against for runs of 1, 1, 3, 4 and 7 ticks before the same or an
 * adjacent facet of that wall blocks again -- twice with the identical blocker
 * id on both sides of the gap, which is what proves the gap is a false
 * negative rather than a wall the camera drove past. 8 is the smallest hold
 * that covers every measured run; 9 adds one tick of margin.
 *
 * 9 is deliberately still less than the census's 12-tick chatter window: a
 * clear run of 9, 10 or 11 ticks releases and, if the correction comes back,
 * is still counted as a re-engagement. The hold closes the measured defect
 * without hollowing out the assertion that measures it.

 * *retracting* for a small blocker that is neither close nor cheap; it never
 * stops being validated against one. The published pose is still proven clear

/*
 * Reduced motion, effect 1 of 2: vertical smoothing of the DESIRED eye.
 *
 * WHAT IT REMOVES. racer.c's authored camera folds a shake impulse straight
 * into the camera's height every tick --
 * `gCameraObject->trans.y_position += y_velocity + shakeMagnitude` -- with
 * shakeMagnitude reversing sign every 5 authored ticks and decaying 0.75 each
 * reversal. On a 30 Hz simulation that is a roughly 6 Hz vertical oscillation,
 * and it is the single loudest source of camera motion a player cannot opt out
 * of. Bumps, landings, and the vehicle-boss impacts that call
 * set_camera_shake(12.0f) all arrive through it.
 *
 * WHY NOT AT THE SOURCE. The obvious fix -- skip the shake add -- is not
 * available, and not for a stylistic reason: platform/sim_hash.c hashes
 * gCameras[PLAYER_FOUR].trans and shakeMagnitude as AUTHORITATIVE state,
 * because the 3P/T.T. camera's pose feeds next-tick object sort, LOD and
 * visibility. Suppressing the impulse there would change the simulation and
 * break the port's whole presentation/authority split. So the shake stays
 * exactly where the game puts it, and comfort only changes what the sidecar
 * asks the resolver to frame.
 *
 * WHY A FILTER RATHER THAN A SUBTRACTION. The impulse is integrated into an
 * authored height that each camera mode then drags toward its own target with
 * a mode-specific, per-tick retention (update_camera_car alone has two
 * branches and a clamp). There is therefore no scalar the sidecar can subtract
 * that reconstructs the shake-free height, and inventing one would be a guess
 * dressed as an inverse. A low-pass makes no claim about the authored
 * internals: it removes the band the shake lives in, has unity DC gain, so it
 * introduces no standing height offset, and reduces every other vertical
 * chatter a reduced-motion player also did not ask for.
 *
 * WHERE IT IS APPLIED, AND WHY THAT IS SAFE. On the resolver's DESIRED eye,
 * before the solve. Smoothing the RESOLVED eye would be a correctness bug: the
 * published pose is the one proven clear of geometry, and a lagged copy of it
 * is not proven clear of anything. Smoothing the desired eye instead means the
 * corrected camera still validates and publishes a pose that is clear, and the
 * only thing comfort changes is which pose it was asked for.
 *
 * TIME-BASED, NOT TICK-BASED. Video.SimulationCadence changes the fixed step,
 * so the coefficient is derived from fixed_delta_seconds. dt/(tau+dt) is the
 * unconditionally stable first-order form: it is in [0,1) for every finite
 * non-negative dt and needs no exp(). A paused tick has dt == 0, which holds
 * the filter rather than stepping it.
 *
 * TAU. 0.13 s. One reversal of the authored shake is ~0.083 s, so the filter
 * passes roughly a fifth of it while its own settling time stays under a fifth
 * of a second -- slow enough to be felt as calm, not as the camera lagging the
 * car. It is a comfort trade and it is opt-in; nothing else in the runtime
 * depends on the number.

 * makes the boom take longer to grow back out once the corridor is already

/*
 * The CAMERA domain's boundary applier (video_config.h's deferred apply).
 *
 * WHERE IT RUNS. thread3_main.c, immediately before the
 * camera_obstruction_runtime_reset() that already precedes every cam_init().
 * That is not a new boundary — it is the existing one, and using it is the
 * entire argument for Camera.Obstruction being SCOPE_LEVEL rather than
 * SCOPE_LIVE (video_config.c's schema row makes the case at length).
 *
 * WHAT MAKES IT SAFE. Nothing here invents an invalidation: the reset that
 * follows this call is the same reset the level boundary has always run, and it
 * clears exactly the state a policy change makes wrong — every slot's
 * last_validated_camera / last_validated_exact_guard (the held image the
 * resolver reuses when its inputs have not moved), the intent records, the
 * presentation depth, and the viewport-to-slot map. The first tick of the new
 * level then rebuilds all of it from freshly captured intents under the new
 * policy, which is the same thing that happens on any level load.
 *
 * The policy is swapped BEFORE the reset so no tick can observe the new policy
 * against pre-change state. Between them there is no tick at all — this runs
 * inside load_level_game, with the level itself not yet loaded.
 *
 * Camera.Comfort shares this applier. Its only per-slot state is the vertical
 * smoother's carry (comfort_smoothed_*), which the same following reset clears,
 * so the second key adds no new invalidation to prove.
