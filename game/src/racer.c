 *
 * Read here rather than at the assignment sites because the mode is set from

 * second_racer_camera_update's transition write, update_camera_finish_race's
 * no-spectate-object fallback, and the challenge end in objects.c), and
 * only the pose author knows which tick the new rule first ran on. Comparing
 * here catches all six, on exactly that tick.

 *
 * The standing exclusion held the finish/post-race viewport discontinuous
 * on EVERY capture of CAMERA_FINISH_RACE / CAMERA_FINISH_CHALLENGE -- dwell
 * ticks included, by design. But the dwell ticks are exactly where those
 * cameras rotate to track the finished racer (update_camera_finish_race's
 * atan2 re-aim; the challenge boom's 0x200/tick orbit): smooth authored
 * motion that a held camera turns into a 30 Hz step while OBJECT_ROOT keeps
 * blending. The subject the camera is actively re-centering drifts for the
 * interpolated presents of every tick and snaps back on each endpoint --
 * the "racer flickers as soon as the perspective switches" report, win and
 * lose alike (measured on the coverage gate's adventure route: 0 of 1,358
 * post-race dwell ticks blended, camexcluded=1389).
 *
 * The cuts the exclusion also covered remain covered without it:
 *   - entry into FINISH_RACE / FINISH_CHALLENGE / FIXED -> the mode-change
 *     note above (racer_camera_note_mode_cut);
 *   - every spectate hop -> the explicit note in update_camera_finish_race;
 *   - the no-spectate fallback -> the next-tick mode note (see the comment
 *     at that early return);
 *   - any future un-noted large re-aim -> the automatic clauses (2000-unit
 *     teleport, 67.5 deg view angle, 20 deg FOV, region, camera_id).
 * A future sub-threshold mid-dwell re-aim -- the hypothetical the standing
 * exclusion existed for -- is smooth-motion-sized by definition, and
 * blending it is the feature, not a risk.
 *
 * The seam itself (presentation_snapshot_set_camera_excluded) stays, with
 * its unit coverage, for callers that really do need a standing hold. This
 * caller still runs every tick so the A/B toggle keeps the original
 * recompute-every-tick semantics, and so the default path actively clears
 * anything a toggled build may have left set.

 * Env-gated CPU-opponent stuck-recovery witness.
 *
 * racer_AI_pathing_inputs() arms a 120-unit cooldown (`unk215`) whenever its
 * "I have been stationary for 60 update units" recovery fires, and that
 * cooldown decays on ONE condition:
 *
 *     if (racer->unk214 == 0 && racer->velocity < -0.5) { racer->unk215 -= updateRate; }
 *
 * NOTE THE SIGN. `racer->velocity` is NEGATIVE for forward motion -- racer.c
 * assigns `racer->velocity = -sqrtf(...)` and the boss animation picks RUN at
 * `velocity < -2.0` -- and it is measured at about -11 for an opponent driving
 * a clean lap, and POSITIVE while the AI's reverse-out state is running (+1.9
 * at unk214=46 in the episode quoted below). So this branch means "the reverse
 * window has expired AND the kart is back to driving forward at speed", not
 * "the kart is reversing". docs/open-items/gameplay.md read it the other way
 * round until this witness measured it; the conclusion is unchanged, because a
 * kart that cannot move satisfies neither reading.
 *
 * So a kart that comes out of the 60-unit reverse window still unable to move
 * never clears the cooldown, and the recovery can never re-arm -- it is gated
 * on `unk215 == 0`. That is measured on the AUTOPILOTED HUMAN at Hot Top Volcano's crater
 * (docs/open-items/gameplay.md); it has never been observed on a genuine
 * opponent, and the production unstick helper (mdkr_autopilot_unstick) is
 * reachable only from the human autopilot branch, so a real opponent has no
 * recovery at all. Whether the wedge is reachable for opponents is what decides
 * that item's classification, and it was hypothesis rather than measurement.
 *
 * WHERE THE OPPONENTS ACTUALLY ARE. update_player_racer()'s
 * `} else { racer_AI_pathing_inputs(...); }` is NOT the opponent path: it sits
 * inside the `if (playerIndex == PLAYER_COMPUTER) update_AI_racer(...) else
 * {...}` split near the top of the function, so it is reached only by a HUMAN
 * kart that the finish/menu hand-off has already relabelled PLAYER_COMPUTER.
 * A genuine opponent is driven by update_AI_racer(), which calls
 * racer_AI_pathing_inputs() only while `racer->unk201 != 0`. The witness is
 * therefore installed in update_AI_racer() and refuses any racer that has ever
 * been seen carrying a real player index, so what it reports is opponents and
 * nothing else.
 *
 * This seam makes it measurable. It is observation-only: it reads racer state
 * and keeps its own side table, writes nothing back, and is completely inert
 * unless MDKR_AI_STUCK_TRACE is set. It deliberately does NOT reuse MDKR_TRACE
 * -- that variable has runtime side effects of its own (docs/open-items/
 * renderer.md, wave "shadowdeep" R1), and a gate that has to enable it to see
 * anything is measuring a configuration players never run.
 *
 * Two counters per racer, both in update-rate units so they read in the same
 * currency as unk213/unk214/unk215:
 *
 *   stall   consecutive units with the cooldown armed while |velocity| < 0.5,
 *           i.e. the exact predicate under which the ROM's decay branch cannot
 *           possibly be taken because the kart is not moving.
 *   nodecay consecutive units with the cooldown armed and the decay branch's
 *           own condition (unk214 == 0 && velocity < -0.5) false. This is the
 *           mechanically exact "made no progress toward re-arming" measure; it
 *           legitimately covers the whole 60-unit reverse window.
 *
 * `arm`/`clear` events bracket every cooldown episode, so a run reports the
 * length distribution of LEGITIMATE stuck-then-recover episodes directly --
 * which is where tests/check_ai_unstick_opponents.py's wedge window comes from.

 * Issue #26 containment: hold a boss to its own authored speed ceiling when the
 * player selected the Enhanced simulation cadence.
 *
 * update_car_velocity_ground() integrates thrust and drag as per-TICK
 * constants (the per-tick sites M0 classifies), which is normally
 * self-cancelling: at
 * equilibrium thrust equals drag and top speed comes out tick-rate
 * independent, whatever the cadence. What breaks that equilibrium is that
 * drag is sampled from wheel 0 ALONE (see the traction accumulation in that
 * function). When wheel 0 lifts while another wheel still touches, the boss
 * keeps full thrust with zero drag and velocity integrates linearly, with
 * nothing to bound it. At one field per tick the unscaled pitch and suspension
 * terms enter that state far more often, so the boss runs away.
 *
 * Ordinary CPU racers cannot reach it: onscreen_ai_racer_physics() probes a
 * single point and, on contact, marks all four wheels grounded on the same
 * surface -- so they always have traction whenever they have thrust. Measured,
 * they are cadence-neutral to within 0.2%, which is why this clamp is scoped
 * to bosses and touches nothing else.
 *
 * The bound is the game's OWN governor, not an invented number:
 * handle_racer_top_speed() caps the AI's virtual bananas at 20 and
 * get_racer_speed_multiplier() turns that into sqrt(((n * 0.025) + 0.561) /
 * 0.004). Under Original a boss sits exactly on that ceiling and never
 * exceeds it; this only stops Enhanced from leaving it.
 *
 * Gated on the launch-time cadence, never on updateRate: under Original a lag
 * tick legitimately arrives with updateRate 3+, and the authored code must
 * handle it byte-identically -- a boss slowing on a lag frame is authored N64
 * behaviour. Under Original this function returns before touching anything, so
 * the authored path executes the same instructions it always did.
 *
 * MDKR_BOSS_CADENCE_COMPAT=0 disables it, which is how the gate reproduces the
 * runaway as a positive control.

/*
 * A Catmull-Rom segment needs FOUR control points: catmull_rom_interpolation()
 * reads data[index + 0], +1, +2 and +3 (objects.c). The fill loop in
 * timetrial_ghost_read() writes four of them too -- it runs
 * `i <= ARRAY_COUNT(vectorY)`, i.e. i = 0..3 -- so four is the real requirement
 * and the N64 declaration of `[3]` is one element short of what the same
 * function reads and writes.
 *
 * On the N64 the fourth store lands in adjacent stack slack (the `pad_sp58`
 * local is what is left of it in the decomp), so the value read back is the one
 * just written and real hardware interpolates the ghost correctly. On LP64 the
 * fourth store lands on the -fstack-protector canary and the process takes
 * SIGABRT in __stack_chk_fail; without the canary it would instead silently
 * corrupt a neighbouring local *and* hand the spline a garbage fourth control
 * point, putting the ghost somewhere it never was.
 *
 * Reached by the normal Time Trial play loop: finish a Time Trial (which records
 * a player ghost and swaps it in for playback), then race the track again -- the
 * ghost is played back on the next race and the game aborts. Confirmed under
 * lldb with the fix reverted: ghostDataIndex=0 (the player's own ghost, not a
 * staff ghost), ghostNodeCount=173 real recorded nodes, i=4 on return.
 * tests/check_race_finish_time.py drives exactly that route and now also asserts
 * that ghost playback actually happened, via the `ghost=`/`gbank=` [PACE] fields.
 *
 * THE FIX IS TWO COUPLED PARTS -- revert them together or not at all:
 *   (a) the array size here, 3 -> 4, and
 *   (b) the loop bound below, `<=` -> `<`,
 * so that exactly the same four stores happen, now in bounds. Changing only (a)
 * back to 3 leaves the loop writing three elements: memory-safe, and therefore
 * NOT caught by any runtime check, but silently wrong -- catmull_rom_interpolation
 * still reads data[3], which is then uninitialised stack, so the ghost is placed
 * somewhere it never was. The _Static_assert below is the tripwire for exactly
 * that half-revert: it makes the mis-sized state fail to COMPILE. Do not neuter
 * it to get a build.
 *
 * Same class and remedy as the fileselect_render trimmedFilename[4] -> [32] and
 * func_8002F440 sp90[6] -> [8] fixes (docs/OPEN_ITEMS.md).
