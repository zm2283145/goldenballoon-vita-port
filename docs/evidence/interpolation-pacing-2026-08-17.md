# Closed-loop presentation pacing and slot-projected alpha, 2026-08-17

## Reported symptoms

After the 2026-08-16 pacing change (open-loop display deadline + second
in-flight admission slot), a 120 Hz ProMotion MacBook showed NEW jitter in
moving characters while driving, and the Timber's Island waterfall shimmer
was not fixed. This investigation re-derived the whole mechanism from first
principles, measured it on the affected machine, and replaced the open-loop
design with a closed-loop one. It supersedes the "Fix" section of
[`waterfall-interpolation-2026-08-16.md`](waterfall-interpolation-2026-08-16.md);
that document's content isolation (the texscroll registry does real work,
mipmap/anisotropy hypotheses rejected) still stands.

## Root causes

Ranked, each with the measurement that proved it. "Ideal" at a 120 Hz
display against the 30 Hz authored tick is an alpha advance of exactly
0.25 tick (250,000 ppm) per displayed frame, every frame.

**RC1a — the interpolation alpha was stamped from the wrong clock.** In the
player-representative free mode, the drawn alpha is the CPU-wake-time
accumulator. Measured on the affected machine (30 s, track 5, autopilot,
foreground WebGPU, 2026-08-17 morning, healthy session, 2026-08-16 build):
alpha-delta p50 253,952 / p95 385,024 / p99 458,752 ppm, min 0 with 15
stalls, max 1,000,000 ppm (a full tick in one frame). Consecutive motion
steps varying 0.5x-1.5x of true velocity IS the character jitter, and a
continuously scrolling high-contrast texture (the waterfalls) is the most
sensitive possible detector of the same modulation. The FIFO queue displays
frames evenly; the CONTENT sampled into them was not evenly spaced — the
"Elusive Frame Timing" failure shape.

**RC1b — two unsynchronized pacers in series.** The 2026-08-16 change added
an open-loop absolute deadline at the reported integer refresh (120.000000
Hz on CLOCK_MONOTONIC, no feedback of any kind) in front of the FIFO
acquire, which already blocks (wgpu Metal: `CAMetalLayer.nextDrawable`
inside `wgpuSurfaceGetCurrentTexture`, `desiredMaximumFrameLatency=1`).
The panel does not run at the reported integer rate: the disciplined clock
(below) measured this panel's real retirement near 249,654 ppm/frame
(~119.83 Hz), ~1,400 ppm slower than the open-loop grid — one whole-slot
overrun roughly every 6 s. Under `MDKR_PRESENT_QUANTUM_STRICT=1` the
mismatch was directly visible as 726/3,568 (20%) failed acquires
(`unavailable`) while the panel had adaptively stepped down — every one a
rendered frame the player saw as a repeat.

**RC1c — the VRR-honesty classifier was blinded.** The deadline change also
routed the classifier's input through the deadline's own sleeps, so it
measured the pacer's sleep quality rather than the display; `[ALPHA-QUANTUM]`
flapped `mode` 3 times in 30 s (alternating grid-snapped and free alpha
regimes mid-run).

**RC2 — the authored endpoint presents off-slot.** In subloop mode no pacing
runs between the tick's wake and the endpoint present, so every 4th frame
leaves tickCompute (the game pass ~5-6 ms, including the real display-list
walk) after its slot. A fixed-refresh FIFO re-times it; a VRR panel shows a
30 Hz ripple. The alpha census also pins the endpoint's phase at 0/1 while
its true residual is r in [0, 0.25), which fattens the alpha-delta tails on
either side of every boundary.

**RC3 — the second in-flight admission slot re-created a rejected hazard.**
Letting replays fill both slots removes the authored endpoint's reservation;
the repo's own 2026-08 experiment table records that failure shape
(endpointSkips 515, "authored frames starve worse than the defect being
fixed"). It also bought nothing once pacing was fixed (queue high-water 1).

**RC4 — content residuals (separate from pacing).** (a) The authored
texscroll endpoint-vs-interior mismatch is at most 3/4 of an S10.5 unit =
~0.023 texel — mathematically real, visually negligible; the waterfall
shimmer was NOT UV math. (b) The large translucent hub water sheet's ~2x
endpoint step is RESOLVED AS AUTHORED CONTENT, not a defect: the hub ocean
(all 24 `RENDER_WATER` segments, level-texture 25 / asset 1156) animates by
a 26-frame texture flipbook advancing one frame every 2 authored ticks
(15 Hz, `track_tex_anim` → `tex_animate_texture`), the same cadence the N64
shows. Frame swaps are tick-quantized by authorship, land only on endpoint
frames by construction, and the interpolation design deliberately excludes
flipbooks from the registry ("a flipbook can never be mistaken for a
scroll"). Everything else about the hub water IS owned: wave-tile matrices,
wave vertex XYZ/RGBA, and the wave grid's own UV drift all interpolate; the
flat far sheet's geometry is static. Any future endpoint-step gate over hub
water crops must model out the 15 Hz flipbook component. (c) Render-only
residuals (kart bob/spin, `camera.c` C7 census) still step at 30 Hz by
design; documented follow-up.

**RC5 — gate blind spots.** The variance bound (3e10 ppm^2) admits a 0.17
tick per-frame sigma; the replay-shed census omitted `stale` from its
denominator; failed acquires were not gated at all; and CI's strict arm
pins the legacy grid, so the player configuration (free/slot) had no
distribution gate.

## The fix (fix/interpolation-pacing)

One closed loop, one phase authority:

1. **Deadline discipline** (`pacing_policy.c`): every present feeds
   `mdkr_present_deadline_feedback(block_ns, unavailable, now)` — how long
   the surface acquire blocked, measured around `wgpuSurfaceGetCurrentTexture`.
   A phase controller (creep 25 us/frame early, clamped push later when the
   block exceeds 1 ms) locks the grid onto real retirement for mismatches
   inside 1,200 ppm with the exact integer-rational grid intact; a rate
   controller (EMA of display-bound completion intervals, 8-sample
   confirmation) re-rates the grid onto the measured period for real slews
   (ProMotion buckets), snapping back to nominal within 600 ppm. Unit tests
   cover the 119.88-under-120 lock, the 120-to-96 Hz re-lock, backoff,
   clamping, and inertness before initialization.
2. **Slot-projected alpha** (`mdkr_present_slot_phase`, wired in
   `present_sched_alpha_projected` behind `platform_present_slot_alpha_active`):
   the drawn phase advances by exactly one display quantum per replay;
   the measured wake phase is consulted only to detect a genuinely missed
   slot (deviation beyond 3/4 quantum re-anchors, counted). The tick/display
   beat's extra slot becomes one soft repeat just below the boundary
   (content-identical to the incoming endpoint). `[ALPHA-QUANTUM]` reports
   `mode=slot`; `[PRESENTSCHED-SUMMARY]` gains `slotsnaps`/`slotanchors`.
   `MDKR_PRESENT_QUANTUM_STRICT=1` still pins the legacy quantize path so
   its arm measures what it always measured.
3. **Endpoint lead + slot gate**: the wake that will make the tick due runs
   `MDKR_PRESENT_ENDPOINT_LEAD_US` (default 3,000) early when the
   accumulator allows; `platform_present_endpoint_gate()` sleeps the
   remainder so the authored endpoint present leaves ON its slot, and
   records how often the game pass overran the lead (`leads`,
   `leadmissmeanus`). Known limitation: the game pass averages ~5-6 ms on
   this machine, so the 3 ms lead partially covers it; sizing the lead from
   its own telemetry is a follow-up once ROG Ally numbers exist.
4. **Reservation restored**: `wgpu_backpressure_limit_before_frame` again
   reserves one slot for the authored endpoint; `platform_present_replay_queue_ahead`
   removed.
5. **Wake precision**: the POSIX `pace_sleep_until` now mirrors the Windows
   shape — coarse sleep to 1 ms short, then 100 us micro-sleeps — because
   Darwin coalesces bare nanosleep wakes by whole milliseconds.
6. **Gates** (`check_pacing_quality.py`): shed-census denominator includes
   `stale`; a presenting session must have `unavailable=0`; the disciplined
   (player-config) arm is now held to grid-relative uniformity bounds
   (alpha-delta p95 <= 1.5x quantum, max <= 2.5x quantum, stalls and
   re-anchors within the beat budget), and `mode=slot` is asserted whenever
   `[PRESENT-DISCIPLINE] active=1`.

Everything above is scoped to discipline mode (native WebGPU + realtime +
`FrameLimit=display` + non-tearing blocking FIFO). Byte-identity proof:
`check_arbitrary_presentation_rates.py` passes unchanged, as do
`check_gpu_backpressure.py`, `check_surface_suspension.py`, and the
pacing/sim_sched/presentation unit suites.

## Measurements

All 30 s, track 5, autopilot, WebGPU display+interpolate, 320x240,
M3 ProMotion MacBook, live foreground session. Ideal alpha step at 120 Hz
over the 30 Hz tick is a constant 250,000 ppm; the census bins at 4,096 ppm,
so 253,952 is the upper edge of the bin CONTAINING the ideal step.

| Metric | 2026-08-16 build, free | 2026-08-16 build, strict | This fix, slot |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| alpha-delta p50 | 253,952 | 253,952 | 253,952 |
| alpha-delta p95 | 385,024 | 503,808 | **253,952** |
| alpha-delta p99 | 458,752 | 503,808 | **253,952** |
| alpha-delta variance (ppm^2) | 4.1e9 | 10.4e9 | **5.0e8** |
| stalls | 15 | 0 | 0 |
| regressions | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| acquire failures (`unavailable`) | 0 | 726 (20%) | 2 |
| displayed p95 / p99 (us) | 9,400 / 11,000 | 10,000 / 12,800 | **9,700 / 10,600** |
| endpoint slot miss (mean) | unpaced (+1-3 ms) | unpaced | **455 us** (891/900 ticks led) |
| mode | free (flapped 3x) | grid (forced) | slot (stable) |

The post-fix alpha distribution is a single histogram bin through p99 —
uniform motion to within census resolution. The residual max=1e6 is one
~29 ms host scheduler stall in 30 s (present in every arm of every build);
its content jump is the correct response to genuinely lost time.

Two implementation defects were found and fixed during live validation,
each with the measurement that exposed it:
- The slot projector originally compared measured phase against a
  zero-based absolute slot sequence; the per-tick constant offset
  (endpoint lead + tick/slot residual) swept through the snap window with
  the beat and re-anchored every replay of the affected ticks (637/2,500
  in one 30 s run, matching the 3-per-tick x beat-fraction prediction).
  The comparison is now increment-based (one displayed frame must advance
  the measured phase by ~one quantum), which is offset-invariant by
  construction; re-anchors fell inside the beat budget immediately.
- `check_pacing_quality.py`'s realtime verdict: two consecutive full-suite
  PASSes on the live session, including the strict M3-baseline arm and the
  new slot arm (grid-relative bounds, honest-arm retry policy mirroring
  the strict arm's bimodality rationale, and an `unavailable` budget of
  presented/1000 — the defect it guards against measured 200x that).

## Acceptance for release (ROG Ally 120 Hz VRR, plus this machine foreground)

- `[PRESENT-DISCIPLINE]`: `unavailable=0`, blockp50 in [400, 2,600] us
  (locked equilibrium), period within 2,000 ppm of the panel's real rate.
- alpha-delta: p95 <= 1.5x quantum, max <= 2.5x quantum, stalls and
  slotanchors within the beat budget (`check_slot_quality`).
- displayed-interval p95 <= 1.2x quantum; zero endpoint admission skips;
  replay shed < 5% with the stale-inclusive denominator.
- Visual pass at the hub spawn and driving past all three falls
  (issues #35/#36 per the 2026-08 issue batch).

## Second wave (2026-08-17, after visual playtest): content coverage

The playtest falsified "waterfalls fixed": cadence was measurably uniform,
yet the falls still flickered and cutscene characters smeared. Both are the
signature of CONTENT that declines interpolation stepping at 30 Hz against
a gliding 120 Hz camera. The per-class verdict census
(`MDKR_SMOOTH_VERDICT=1` + `MDKR_PRESENT_SCHED_TRACE=1`) attributed it on
the real hub route:

- **WORLD_SCROLL held 46% of its verdicts (`heldpermille=456`), all
  `UV_HOLD`.** Two mechanisms: (a) the measured path's two-tick confirm
  rule can NEVER pass for a scroller whose rate varies per tick (measured
  du sequences -83, -72, -60 on the hub's eased/camera-coupled sheets —
  every such surface held forever); (b) every scroller's first visible
  tick held (`holdunpub`), a constant churn while driving.
- **The authored texscroll registry never engages in the hub at all**
  (`uvauth_reg=0`, now a permanent `[SNAPSHOT]` census): the hub does not
  run `obj_loop_texscroll`, so the 08-16 premise that the authored
  {rate, phase} path served the falls was wrong there. It serves race
  tracks that have `BHV_TEXTURE_SCROLL` objects.
- The falls' main vertical scroll (constant dv=128/tick) did confirm and
  blend — the flicker came from the held companion layers around it.

**Fix:** `gfx_presentation_packet_lookup_uv_scroll` now accepts a
single-tick measured record when the batch itself corroborates it — two or
more triangles whose corners all state one fold-resolved displacement (the
mis-resolved-wrap failure the two-tick rule guarded against cannot move
independent triangles by the same wrong amount). One-triangle batches keep
the two-tick rule. The record's du describes exactly the [T, T+1] interval
being replayed, so this is also the CORRECT value for variable-rate
scrollers, not a compromise. Hub route result: heldpermille 456 → 27,
`uvscrollsolo=74,147` accepts, gates all green (194/194 unit,
byte-identity, pacing).

Character/cutscene note: OBJECT_ROOT blends 99.8%; the deformation
contract correctly lerps within one animation and snaps on id changes.
The cutscene backdrop layers were part of the held-scroll population above.
If smear persists in cutscenes after this fix, the next suspects are the
`deformincompatible` population (~2.6/tick, needs per-owner attribution)
and sample-and-hold persistence at the panel's adaptive ~91-99 Hz.

## Third wave (2026-08-17): menu-shell scenes captured zero cameras

The second playtest narrowed the residual to cutscene/attract characters
(Taj's greeting entrance, title-screen racer demos) and "falls terrible
only while moving". Frame dumps made the mechanism unambiguous: in the Taj
bridge shot, consecutive 120 Hz frames measured 0.33/0.33/0.33/6.2 — three
near-identical interiors then a 19x endpoint jump. UV scrolls kept gliding
(which is why static falls looked fine) while the camera and every object
stepped at 30 Hz; a scene whose framing steps takes the falls with it,
hence "fine static, terrible moving". Scheduler telemetry agreed:
`interp=6872` replays but `interpviews=5712` — 1,160 replays drew with no
interpolated camera view at all.

Root cause: `capture_cameras` (presentation_snapshot_walk.c) captured
cameras under `GAMEMODE_MENU` only for `RACETYPE_CUTSCENE_1/2` levels. The
title attract demos are live AI races loaded by the menu shell as
`RACETYPE_DEFAULT` (player count 0, not the cutscene sentinel), and the
Taj greeting cinematic falls in the same class — those scenes captured
ZERO cameras every tick, so `mdkr_camera_interpolated_view_projections`
had nothing to substitute and the fail-closed design correctly rendered
authored frames only. Fix: capture for EVERY loaded level scene under the
menu shell; the menu-borrow hazard the old gate guarded against still
cannot pass, because a borrowing menu never latches an authored camera
record and `authored_cameras_copy()` returns zero entries for it.

Frame-dump proof, same shot, same window: flat ~1.96 per-frame advance
after the fix (no periodicity). Gates: camera snapshot coverage,
presentation lifecycle, byte-identity, pacing quality, 194/194 unit — all
PASS.

Also established this wave: the wave-grid topology snap on 5x5 window
shifts is CORRECT (buffer slots are reused by different world tiles, so
cross-shift vertex lerp would smear two tiles together); cutscene-vehicle
wheel/prop parts advance `modelIndex` per tick (authored flipbook class);
and computer racers' vertex animation is authored at 15 Hz.

## Remaining work

- Visual re-test: falls while driving, Taj entrance, title attract racers.
- Per-owner attribution of the residual `deformincompatible` (~2.6/tick)
  population if character smear persists anywhere after this wave.
- ROG Ally 120 Hz VRR qualification with the same acceptance numbers.
- Endpoint lead auto-sizing from `leadmissmeanus` telemetry; the game-pass
  cost (~5-6 ms, dominated by the real walk) also bounds how good any lead
  can be at 120 Hz — pipelining the walk is the structural fix if the Ally
  measurements demand it.
- C7 render-only residual stepping (kart bob/spin) — design follow-up.
- (RC4b closed 2026-08-17: the hub water sheet's step is the authored 15 Hz
  ocean flipbook, not an ownership gap. If sub-tick smoothing of flipbooks
  is ever wanted, the contract would be phase-aligned frame selection or a
  two-frame cross-fade — both diverge from authored appearance and are
  deliberately NOT planned.)

## DEEP DIVE VERDICT (2026-08-17, investigation paused at user request)

**The dominant remaining defect is not in this renderer.** Frame-delivery
accounting across all five instrumented play sessions: 23-55% of fully
rendered, submitted frames were REFUSED a drawable at the present boundary
(`[WGPU-BACKPRESSURE] unavailable` = 23,094/47,459; 10,196/18,474;
2,037/13,373; 6,451/21,300; 2,879/12,528) and silently shown as repeats.
Classification is proven three ways: (1) elimination on independent
counters — discipline-layer unavailable=0 (no Timeout/Outdated while
presentable), [PRESENT-MODE] rows = 1 + user resizes (no Outdated/Lost),
no 120-consecutive-timeout fatal despite bursts (only Occluded resets the
recovery counter); (2) disassembly of the vendored wgpu-native v29.0.1.1:
`Surface::acquire_texture` checks `NSWindow.occlusionState` BEFORE
`nextDrawable` and returns Occluded (0x30001) without acquiring when
NSWindowOcclusionStateVisible is clear; (3) the upstream regression family
is documented: wgpu-native #590, wgpu #9430 / #9410 / #10087 (introduced
by wgpu PR #9141 in v29) — including terminal-launched apps never
receiving the visible bit. Every instrumented session was terminal-
launched. The app is occlusion-blind (sdl2-compat has no occlusion flag)
and treats Occluded as benign-transient, so each storm frame silently
drops a rendered image: dead-center whole-frame strobing, worst while
eye-tracking a pan, invisible to offscreen dumps, and untouched by all
seven renderer-layer fixes (each of which was real and remains landed).

Resume protocol (info per minute; record unavailable= for each):
1. Launch via Finder/.app instead of terminal, same hub pan (~2 min).
   unavailable~0 + clean falls => confirmed; fix = patch/pin wgpu-native
   occlusion gate + app-side occlusion cross-check + status-split
   telemetry in wgpu_report_backpressure.
2. Accessibility "Dim Flashing Lights" check (30 s).
3. MDKR_RENDERER=gl A/B (2 min) — clean GL indicts the WebGPU present.
4. Fixed 60 Hz display mode A/B (2 min) — VRR amplifier check.
5. External non-miniLED display (2 min) — panel-layer check.
6. F9 bracket while flashing; dumps clean + eyes flashing locks in the
   present-layer classification.

Secondary (real, lower priority, from the authored-walk audit): the void
curtain still has three port-amplified caps that can drop waterfall
content on authored frames under the widened lens — gVoidPrimLimit=45
saturation (the 44-plane sorter fix RAISED demand into this ceiling),
D_8011D47C is s8 (index truncation above 128 entries => garbage quads /
slivers), and the whole-curtain bail at 175 entries. Instrument
per-tick {D_8011D49E, gVoidPrimCount saturation, sorter-abort hits} in
one pan bracket, then raise limits in lockstep (prim limit ~180, s16
indices, clamp-not-bail at 175).

## FOURTH WAVE (2026-08-17, session6 forensics): shim the bit, trust the dumps

Session6 (one hour live, defense from merge c83b24c active, F9 bracket
frames 442751-443398 while the falls flashed) settled three questions at
once.

**1. The pump-and-retry defense is necessary but not sufficient.** The
ledger read submitted=440553 presented=436629 unavailable=3924
occludedvisible=3924 occlretries=15699 occlrecovered=3: refusals fell from
23-55% of frames to 0.89%, but every surviving refusal exhausted all four
retries — the stale occlusionState bit persists far longer than the 1.2 ms
an in-frame retry can afford, and only 3 of 3,924 events recovered. A
notification-race defense cannot close a multi-millisecond stale window.
Fix landed: an in-process method swizzle on -[NSWindow occlusionState]
(platform_macos_install_occlusion_shim, platform_sdl_min.c) that ORs
NSWindowOcclusionStateVisible into every answer the present library reads.
Every window in this process is a game surface; "always presentable" is
the correct policy, and MDKR_NO_OCCLUSION_SHIM=1 restores the stock getter
for A/B. Smoke proof: 1793/1793 presents, unavailable=0, occlretries=0 —
the refusal class is gone at the source, not raced.

**2. The F9 capture rig was polluting its own brackets.** [PRESENTSCHED]
presents-per-tick was 4.00 for 110,700 straight ticks and dropped to ~2.15
exactly at CAPTURE-START, recovering to 3.88 at CAPTURE-STOP: the
synchronous readback+PPM write halved the present rate (120 -> ~64 fps)
for exactly the window being captured. Worse, the rate deficit exposed a
real slot-projector gap: the first replay of a tick was PINNED to one
quantum, so a ~2-present tick drew endpoint/quarter pairs (alpha 0.25)
where the pose pair had really advanced half a tick — the bracket's
E,1/4,E,1/4 cadence was the rig plus this pin, not the live defect. Both
fixed: the PPM write moved to a bounded async writer thread (lossless
blocking policy for --dump-frames fixtures, drop-and-count for F9; 119.5
fps sustained WITH every-frame dumps in the smoke run), and the slot
projector's first-replay branch now measures elapsed phase since the
previous tick's last replay (still increment-based/offset-invariant) and
anchors to the quantized measured phase when more than two healthy slots
elapsed (mdkr_present_slot_phase, unit-tested both directions). [CAPTURE]
rows now carry dt_us so a polluted bracket can never masquerade again.

**3. The rendered content stream is PROVEN clean.** A single-frame
anomaly scan over all 647 bracket PPMs (frame N vs both neighbors vs
neighbor-skip diff) found ZERO content flashes — no vanishing falls, no
one-frame breaks, at any threshold. The void-curtain capacity fix held.
Everything upstream of the present boundary is now measured healthy:
4.00 presents/tick, alpha p50=p95 ideal, content stream anomaly-free.
Whatever remained on the glass was injected at or after present — which
is exactly where the 3,924 unrescued refusals live.

Also landed for localization-forever: rate-limited [WGPU-REFUSAL] rows
(first 64 verbatim then every 64th, with frame + status + presentable bit
+ t_ns) and a [WGPU-BACKPRESSURE-PERIODIC] cumulative ledger every 4096
submissions, distinct tag so expect_one parsers never collide. A latent
link break (g_frameCounter in the capture-pose probe vs the standalone
presentation-snapshot unit test) surfaced during this rebuild and was
fixed in the test harness — the prior battery had exercised a stale
binary.

Verification: 194/194 units, check_pacing_quality PASS (mode=slot,
variance 122 ppm, transitions 0), check_arbitrary_presentation_rates PASS
(byte identity), check_weather_presentation_identity PASS,
check_gpu_backpressure PASS, live smoke unavailable=0.

## FIFTH WAVE (2026-08-17, four-agent independent review): the amplifier was ours

Per the owner's direction, four independent Fable agents reviewed the
accumulated evidence — an agnostic pixel-level diagnostician, a 1 Hz code
tracer, a WebGPU/Metal specialist, and an adversarial reviewer of the whole
chain. They converged:

**Unified percept model.** The player has been reporting ONE perceptual
signature — a ~1/second hitch of the high-contrast falls during smooth-
pursuit panning — produced by DIFFERENT generators across eras: the
occlusion refusal storm (sessions 1-6, killed by the shim), then session7's
measured 999.90 +/- 0.06 ms metronomic acquire stall. A doubled frame
during pursuit displaces the image ~2x the pan step on the retina; the
falls (texture stddev 66, brightest object, ~30%/frame scroll
decorrelation) are the worst-case stimulus in the scene. Static camera =
no pursuit = invisible. Frame dumps are clean BY CONSTRUCTION — it is a
timeline defect. This is why every content-side fix "changed nothing".

**The amplifier: WGPU_SURFACE_MAX_FRAME_LATENCY 1 == a two-drawable Metal
pool.** wgpu-hal v29 maps latency N to CAMetalLayer.maximumDrawableCount
N+1 with allowsNextDrawableTimeout disabled; at 1 that is the legal
minimum: one drawable on glass (held longer by WindowServer for a
composited window), one in flight, ZERO slack — any ~1 ms system beat
costs a full +8.3 ms inside a blocking nextDrawable. The libultraship
precedent cited for the pin does not hold on Metal (its macOS backend
runs a default THREE-deep pool via SDL_Renderer; gfx_metal.cpp:698).
FIXED: latency 2 in gfx_webgpu.c AND app_host.cpp (the depth is a
property of the configuration and must ride every configure);
check_app_adopted_pacing expectations updated with the measured
rationale.

**Session7's generator was probably the measurement rig itself.** The
session was launched with --dump-frames and no MDKR_DUMP_FROM filter:
every present of the whole session was synchronously read back and
written (53,215 PPMs, ~196 GB at ~440 MB/s) — a constant-rate dirty-page
torrent whose kernel flush cadence is metronomic. Launch protocol fixed:
user sessions get MDKR_DUMP_FROM=999999999 so dumps exist ONLY inside F9
brackets. The no-dump control run is the decisive next measurement.

**Third occlusion-storm site found and fixed.** check_app_adopted_pacing
was failing 100%-refused ("active display session required" — a masking
message): the LAUNCHER presents through wgpu before engine init, so the
shim never installed for adopted-window/probe-.app paths. The shim is now
installed at common SDL init, at launcher init
(platform_present_occlusion_shim_install), and in the engine window
branch (idempotent). Gate now PASSES.

**Exonerated by source audit:** SDL3/sdl2-compat pump (nothing ~1000 ms
gated; session7 provably had no controller open), wgpu-native timers
(binary links no CoreVideo, no timer machinery), mdkr64's own loops (no
1 Hz logic), EDR (surface is SDR BGRA8Unorm), aliasing-as-primary (static
would shimmer too — though see below).

**Remaining ranked follow-ups if any flash survives the pool fix + clean
launch:** (1) stall-recovery re-spacing — after a >1-slot acquire gap the
policy currently DROPS the 3/4-alpha present (alpha runs 1.0->0.25->0.5->
1.0; p99 alpha-delta 503808 ppm, ~530/session), turning each stall into a
1/2x->2x velocity wobble; re-space or slew instead. (2) Falls-material
mip/aniso: measured 2.5x pan-vs-static motion-compensated temporal
residual on the falls (6.5 vs 2.7; rock 1.2) — the continuous

## SEVENTH WAVE (2026-08-18): root cause found and fixed — walk-order
## mispaired WORLD_STATIC vertex blends

The owner's F9 bracket (session /tmp/mdkr-f9-falls, drive STRAIGHT at the
twin-falls door, no pan) finally captured the defect inside the dumps:
whole falls sheets strobing. The decisive measurement was the per-frame
presence timeline of one falls column against the [PRESENTSCHED] tick
boundaries: **ON at every endpoint slot, ABSENT for exactly the three
interpolated slots of afflicted ticks** (frames 11653-55 of tick 2919,
11661-63 of tick 2921; pattern ON-off-off-off-ON), while a mispositioned
jagged white mass appeared at a single mid-slot (11654). Static-control
bracket: clean. So the defect lives ONLY in interpolated replays, is
whole-batch coherent, is not tick-phase locked to one slot, and every
authored frame is perfect — which is why five weeks of delivery/cadence/
alpha/content forensics stayed green ("pan-only" in the original report
was wrong: ANY camera motion triggers it; the F9 bracket was a straight
drive).

Mechanism, proven by bisection then structurally: level-geometry
deformation pairs are keyed (owner, generation, class, viewport,
ordinal=stream<<16|batch) where `stream` is dkr_deformation_begin_stream's
per-owner VISIT COUNTER — all level segments share one ROOT owner, so
streams enumerate segments in BSP WALK ORDER (tracks.c segment traversal,
camera-position keyed). Camera motion permutes the walk order; the same
key then binds two DIFFERENT segment batches across adjacent ticks, and
neighboring level geometry sits far under the 4096-unit
DKR_DEFORMATION_SANITY_DELTA ceiling, so the mispair blends: falls quads
lerp into the cliff (vanish), foreign batches lerp across the view (white
shards), whole regions alternate as order churns per tick (black strobe
storms in door corridors). The 2026-08-17 sanity-ceiling comment in
gfx_pc_dkr.c had already described these percepts; the ceiling catches
model-extent mispairs, not neighbor-batch mispairs.

[SMOOTH-VERDICT] in the surgical arm: WATER_WAVE blend=109,986,
WORLD_SCROLL blend=45,507, OBJECT_ROOT blend=100,704 — untouched.

FIX (this commit): WORLD_STATIC vertex-position blending default OFF
(gfx_pc_dkr.c dkr_replay_world_static_vertex_blend_enabled;
MDKR_WORLD_STATIC_VERTEX_BLEND=1 restores for A/B). Rationale: a CORRECT
world-static pair blends identical bytes — the stage carries zero image
value and all of the mispair risk. WATER_WAVE (real vertex motion) keeps
its topology-keyed blending; WORLD_SCROLL/objects/particles unaffected.
If static-world blending is ever needed, pairing must first move to
content-stable keys (DKR-R presentation_identity.cpp is the working
precedent in this exact game).

Falsified along the way (2026-08-18 PM): draw-distance/object-admission
(owner live A/B at 400%, arm verified hot via [DRAWDIST]), and the
mip/aniso scintillation arm as THE percept (three-arm A/B measured no
residual change — though note the arm's validity caveat: the first
attempt measured the wrong scenery; the corrected repro then found the
true mechanism before the scintillation A/B was re-run at the falls).
The 15 Hz flipbook-beat and BSP-order-percept theories are superseded:
BSP order churn is real but its role is TRIGGER of the pairing desync,
not a direct percept.

## EIGHTH WAVE (2026-08-19, issue #44): the two post-race camera rails —
## finish-camera dwell holds and the borrowed-lens latch conflict

Two independent camera-side defects, both invisible to pixels-only
instruments and both found from the census/journal rails (the voidinterp
lesson again).

Defect (a) — racer flicker at the lap-3 finish. The Task 9 standing
exclusion (racer_camera_apply_finish_exclusion) held CAMERA_FINISH_RACE /
CAMERA_FINISH_CHALLENGE discontinuous on EVERY capture, dwell ticks
included. Dwell ticks are exactly where those cameras smoothly track the
finished racer (atan2 re-aim / 0x200-per-tick boom orbit): the shot
stepped at 30 Hz while OBJECT_ROOT kept blending, so the one object the
camera re-centers drifted per interpolated present and snapped per
endpoint. Measured on the coverage gate's adventure route: 17 spectate
hops, 0 of 1,358 dwell ticks blended, camexcluded=1389. Fix: the caller
no longer asserts the exclusion by default
(MDKR_TEST_FINISH_CAMERA_EXCLUDE=1 restores it for A/B, the
MDKR_WORLD_STATIC_VERTEX_BLEND idiom; toggled build reproduces the legacy
numbers exactly). Cut coverage survives via the mode-change and
spectate-hop one-shot notes plus the automatic clauses (2000 units /
67.5 deg / 20 deg FOV / region / slot). After: 1,356 of 1,358 dwell ticks
blend and every classified hop still refuses to pair
(check_camera_snapshot_coverage's new post-race dwell floor).

Defect (b) — cleared-track preview flyby uniformly unsmoothed. The
authored-camera conflict rule was firing silently once per preview tick:
menu_camera_centre rewrites the active camera to the fixed menu pose and
runs viewport_main -> camSetProjMtx for its overlay pass — a second,
different record for viewport 0 on top of the flyby scene's own — and a
conflicted set publishes ZERO cameras, which no counter named (cam0..7
merely stop advancing). New census: camconflict= (the defect signal) and
camborrowskips=. Measured red on the win-then-re-enter route:
camconflict=1781, zero [CAMERA-CUT] rows across the ~1,450-tick preview.
Fix: a depth-counted authored-camera BORROW scope
(presentation_snapshot_authored_camera_borrow_begin/end) bracketing
menu_camera_centre's viewport_main call; a borrowing latch refuses to
file, and cam_build_view_basis leaves sShadowRegisterGameplayVp clear
under an open borrow so menu content drawn with the borrowed lens is
never a VP-substitution target. The conflict rule is NOT weakened: a
genuinely ambiguous double-lens tick still fails closed. After:
camconflict=0, camborrowskips=1781, preview window 1,457/1,457 journal
rows blend; census otherwise byte-identical. The walk.c gate comment that
claimed "a borrowing menu never runs camSetProjMtx for a level scene" was
false and is corrected.

New instruments: camconflict= / camborrowskips= in [SNAPSHOT]; the
adventure-preview-reentry gate arm (win, door re-entry, held-open
preview) and the post-race dwell-blend floor in
check_camera_snapshot_coverage.py.
