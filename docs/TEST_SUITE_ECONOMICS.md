# Test suite economics

The complete suite is **204 tasks** as of 2026-08-13. It took between 2¼ and
3¼ hours when this document was written; the `native_layout` change recorded
in §6.1 has since removed about 27 minutes of that. This document measures
where the time goes, names the overlaps that could be collapsed, and records
what evidence a future implementer must produce before collapsing them.

**Every measurement below was taken against the 135-task manifest** that the
suite carried on 2026-08-05/06, and the numbers are left exactly as measured.
They are still the best available evidence for the tasks they name, but they
do not describe the current wall clock: the online-multiplayer work has since
added tasks, so treat the totals as a floor rather than a current figure. Do
not scale them — re-measure before quoting a new total.

**Nothing here removes or weakens a gate.** No task was deprecated, merged, or
subsetted in the pass that produced this document. Every verdict below is a
*candidate* with a stated precondition. The release gate remains the complete
run: `python3 tools/run_checks.py --jobs 6`, printing
`complete suite, N/N tasks` — currently `204/204`. Any other verdict is
printed as `SUBSET n/204 tasks:` followed by the restriction that produced it,
and a `SUBSET` line never counts as a release gate. See
[`RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`](RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md) §2b.

## 1. Method, and what these two runs can and cannot show

Two complete-suite logs, same 135-task manifest as it stood on 2026-08-05/06
([`../tools/run_checks.py`](../tools/run_checks.py)). The manifest is 204 tasks
today; these two runs are reported unchanged, at their original size:

| | run 1 | run 2 |
|---|---|---|
| log | `/tmp/m9-full-suite.log` | `/tmp/final-suite.log` |
| wall clock | 193m53s | 135m07s |
| verdict | `FAIL — 5/135` | `FAIL — 2/135` |
| finished | 2026-08-05 22:58 | 2026-08-06 01:58 |
| host | loaded (concurrent work) | quiet |

**The runner accounts for its own time.** Summing every per-task duration gives
193m50s and 135m06s — within 3s and 1s of the two wall-clock totals. The runner
is sequential by construction ("It runs sequentially because several checks
intentionally create and remove `save/eeprom.bin`",
[`../tools/run_checks.py`](../tools/run_checks.py) lines 14–16), so there is no
hidden concurrency and no per-task overhead worth modelling. Task time *is*
suite time.

### Two confounds that limit what the delta means

**The two runs are not the same tree.** Run 2 ran at `57154d6`; run 1 predates
`0c6e433` (its `camera_obstruction_runtime` banner lacks the unset-default
clause that commit added). Between those trees, exactly these files changed
under `tests/`, `tools/`, `game/` and `platform/`:

```
game/src/camera_obstruction_runtime.c   tests/check_camera_obstruction_runtime.py
tests/check_asset_swap_invariants.py    tests/check_taj_character_select.py
tests/check_authored_rng_compat.py      tools/run_checks.py
platform/fast3d/PROVENANCE.md           tools/web/build_web.sh
```

`check_taj_character_select.py` alone changed by 197 lines. Every other check
script is byte-identical between the runs, so for every task except the seven
touched by that list, the run-1/run-2 delta is host load and the camera-default
engine change — not a rewritten gate.

**A failed task did not necessarily run to completion.** Its duration is then
not a measurement of the gate's cost:

- `browser_taj_character_select` — run 1, `FAIL` in **0s**. Not a measurement
  at all; the staging fault fixed in `143f1f6` aborted it before it started.
- `taj_character_select_ultrawide` — run 1, `FAIL` in 1m49s, against the
  pre-rewrite gate. Not comparable to run 2's 22s.
- `arbitrary_presentation_rates` — run 2, `FAIL` in 56s. This one **is**
  comparable: the script accumulates failures into a list and only aborts on a
  `RuntimeError`; the two reported failures are content assertions, so all 21
  arms ran (`tests/check_arbitrary_presentation_rates.py` lines 556–580).
- `browser_runtime` — run 1, `FAIL` in 2m03s on a cadence budget, versus 3m59s
  passing. The failing run stopped short.
- `app_adopted_pacing` — run 2, `FAIL` in 23s versus 13s passing.

Every table below is annotated accordingly. No cost or ratio claim in this
document rests on a row marked `FAILED` or `changed`.

---

## 2. The measured cost table

Every task that cost ≥60s in either run. 41 of 135 tasks qualify.

| task | role | run 1 | run 2 | run2/run1 | note |

| `taj_character_select_ultrawide` | native | 1m49s | 22s | — | FAILED run 1; script rewritten |
| `camera_obstruction_lifecycle_runtime` | release | 1m43s | 1m30s | 0.87 | |
| `bluey2_rematch` | native | 1m37s | 26s | 0.27 | **halved** |
| `taj_vehicle_sweep` | native | 1m35s | 1m46s | 1.12 | flat |
| `camera_obstruction_performance_runtime` | release | 1m31s | 1m19s | 0.87 | |
| `door_glyphs` | native | 1m29s | 20s | 0.22 | **halved** |

| `taj_challenges` | native | 1m06s | 1m29s | 1.35 | got *slower* on the quiet host |
| `overlay_pause` | native | 1m05s | 4s | 0.06 | **halved** |
| `collision_headroom` | native | 1m03s | 1m13s | 1.16 | flat |

### Where the time is concentrated

| | run 1 | run 2 |
|---|---|---|
| top 5 tasks | 90m09s (46.5%) | 62m49s (46.5%) |
| top 10 tasks | 112m05s (57.8%) | 79m06s (58.5%) |
| top 20 tasks | 139m41s (72.1%) | 98m13s (72.7%) |
| the 94 tasks under 60s in both runs | — | 20m17s (15.0%) |

The concentration is identical to a tenth of a percent across a loaded and a
quiet host. **Deprecating cheap gates is not an optimisation.** Deleting all 94
sub-minute tasks — 70% of the manifest, including every source-role audit and
every mutation control that costs nothing — would buy 20 minutes and cost the
suite most of its coverage.

By manifest role:

| role | tasks | run 1 | run 2 | share of run 2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `native` | 86 | 74m37s | 41m59s | 31.1% |
| `layout` | 1 | 37m09s | 36m47s | 27.2% |
| `release` | 23 | 61m56s | 30m42s | 22.7% |
| `browser` | 6 | 7m32s | 12m56s | 9.6% |
| `instrumented` | 2 | 9m28s | 9m50s | 7.3% |
| `asan` | 5 | 2m09s | 1m51s | 1.4% |
| `ctest` | 1 | 45s | 48s | 0.6% |
| `source` | 7 | 11s | 10s | 0.1% |
| `browser_save`, `rom`, `wasm` | 4 | 3s | 3s | 0.0% |

One task in one role is 27% of a quiet release run.

---

## 3. Load sensitivity, and what a flat task is telling you

Restricting to tasks that passed in **both** runs with an **unchanged** script —
the only rows where the delta is attributable to host conditions:

**Halved or better on the quiet host** (ratio ≤ 0.50): `overlay_pause` (0.06),
`taj_results_portrait` (0.19), `taj_hud_portrait` (0.21), `door_glyphs` (0.22),
`bluey2_rematch` (0.27), `presentation_matrix` (0.28), `texture_lineswap`
(0.28), `2p_human_binding` (0.29), `render_purity` (0.32), `resource_plateau`
(0.38), `presentation_breadth` (0.39), `challenge_modes` (0.42),
`framed_world_views` (0.44), `presentation_shadows` (0.45), `remaster_lighting`
(0.49).

These are all the same shape: a Python driver that spawns many short-to-medium
headless engine processes back to back. Under contention each spawn pays for the
whole machine's scheduling; on a quiet host it does not. `overlay_pause` at 0.06
(1m05s → 4s) is the extreme and deserves its own look — a 16× spread on an
unchanged script is larger than contention alone comfortably explains.

**Flat regardless of load** (ratio ≥ 0.95). These matter more than the halving
list, because a flat task is one whose cost is *not* contention, and therefore
one that cannot be made faster by running the suite on a quieter box:

- `native_layout` (0.99), `full_ubsan` (1.05), `array_bounds_sweep` (1.01) —
  compute-bound instrumented replays on warm build trees. See §6.
- `browser_taj_persistence` (**exactly** 3m11s in both runs),
  `browser_resource_plateau` (2m01s / 2m02s) — these are **real-time bound**.
  The browser gates poll rather than sleep (`check_browser_taj_persistence.py`
  lines 61–66 is an 80 ms poll loop, not a fixed wait), but the page advances at
  the display's rAF cadence, so N frames take N ÷ rate seconds of wall clock no
  matter how fast the host is. `browser_runtime`'s own pass line proves the
  arithmetic: "3600 wasm/WebGPU host opportunities … median 30.0 fps" — 3600
  frames at 30 fps is 120s of an observed 3m59s task. The browser lane's 12m56s
  has a hard real-time floor and is not an optimisation target.
- `vehicle_sweep` (1.11), `taj_vehicle_sweep` (1.12), `collision_headroom`
  (1.16), `taj_challenges` (1.35), `webgpu_content_census` (1.47) — *slower* on
  the quiet host. The camera-obstruction default flipped from legacy to modern
  in `0c6e433` between the runs, which adds real per-tick resolver work to every
  route these tasks drive. That is the honest reading available from these two
  logs; a clean before/after on one tree would confirm it. The default went back
  to `observe` when the correction became an opt-in setting, forward to `modern`
  on 2026-08-07, and back to `observe` the same day when device acceptance
  rejected the default. So these figures **over-state** the configuration the
  suite runs today: the resolver work is off on the default path, and the gates
  that exercise it set `MDKR_CAMERA_OBSTRUCTION=modern` explicitly.

---

## 4. Overlap analysis

Each cluster below states what each gate asserts that its siblings do not,
then a verdict:

- **MERGE CANDIDATE** — same binary route, disjoint assertions, could run in one
  pass.
- **REDUNDANT** — one gate's assertions are a strict subset of another's, proven.
- **KEEP-SEPARATE** — different build role, different failure isolation, or a
  control that must stay independent.

### 4.1 `world_fx_capture` / `world_fx_matrix` / `world_shadows` — KEEP-SEPARATE

Combined run-2 cost 2m52s. All three drive the native binary on both `gl` and
`webgpu`, and two of them share a route exactly: `nav_to_time_trial_race.txt`,
3500 frames, capture at 3499, `MDKR_LOAD_TRACK=5`. That is where the similarity
ends.

| | `world_fx_capture` | `world_fx_matrix` | `world_shadows` |
|---|---|---|---|
| scenes | 1 (track 5, 1P) | 8 (5 tracks + hub + 2P + 4P) | 1 (track 5, 1P) |
| `MDKR_WORLD_SHADOW` | pinned `0` | pinned `0` | the variable under test (`0`/`1`/fault) |
| telemetry read | `[WORLD-FX]`, `[SHADOW-PLAN]` | `[WORLD-FX]`, `[SHADOW-PLAN]` | `[DEPTH]`, `[WORLD-SHADOW]` |
| frames dumped | yes | **no** | yes |
| cadence | default | default | `enhanced` + `MDKR_SYNTH_FIELDS=1` |

Unique to each, with nothing equivalent in the siblings:

- `world_fx_capture` — an **exact** pinned caster census
  (`triangles=1199, ranges=130, static=541, dynamic=658, matrices=18`), the
  material-class census (`opaque > 1_000_000`, `masked > 0`), and the
  `MDKR_WORLD_FX_MATRIX_CONTROL=drop` mutation control that must collapse that
  census to zero *while leaving the rendered frame byte-identical*. That last
  pairing is the whole point of the gate: the instrument is provably inert.
- `world_fx_matrix` — the only gate that reaches the 1024-pixel cascade tiers,
  because it is the only one that runs 2P and 4P; and the only one asserting
  GL/WebGPU telemetry-tuple equality. Its `[WORLD-FX]` bounds are deliberately
  weaker (`> 0`, not exact) because they must hold across eight scenes.
- `world_shadows` — decal-fallback truthfulness
  (`on.decal < off.decal * 9/10`), the four-way darkening classification, the
  backend self-naming check, and the `MDKR_TEST_WORLD_SHADOW_RESOURCE_FAIL`
  fault arm that must latch at exactly 3 failures and reproduce the legacy frame
  byte-for-byte.

**Verdict: KEEP-SEPARATE.** `world_fx_capture` and `world_shadows` cannot share a
process even on their shared route, because the shared route is precisely where
they disagree: one requires shadows off for the whole run, the other toggles
them. `world_fx_matrix` shares no route with either. Combined saving from any
merge is under a minute and would cost three separate failure-isolation domains.

`shadow_plausibility` (1m40s) is often assumed to overlap `world_shadows`. It
does not: it is the only gate reading `staleCasters` / `staleWorst` /
`implausible` / `invalidWorldRecv`, backed by its own
`MDKR_TEST_SHADOW_BOGUS_CASTER=900.0` positive control. `world_shadows` never
parses `[WORLD-FX]` at all and asserts nothing about caster provenance.

### 4.2 The camera runtime family — one MERGE CANDIDATE, the rest KEEP-SEPARATE

Nine `release`-role tasks, 11m03s combined in run 2.

**Correct the premise first.** There is no shared 5200-frame route across this
family. Grepping the whole family for `5200` returns exactly two hits:

```
tests/check_camera_obstruction_runtime.py:158:    parser.add_argument("--frames", type=int, default=5200)
tests/check_camera_emergency_readability_runtime.py:18:  parser.add_argument("--frames", type=int, default=5200)
```

and the second imports `run`/`inspect`/`field`/`DETAIL` from the first. The
actual route matrix:

| task | frames | route | players |
|---|---|---|---|
| `camera_obstruction_runtime` | 5200 | `race_drive_long.txt` | 1P |
| `camera_emergency_readability_runtime` | 5200 | `race_drive_long.txt` | 1P |
| `camera_obstruction_display_matrix` | 3600 | `race_drive_long.txt` | 1P |
| `camera_projection_fallback_runtime` | 3400 | `race_drive_long.txt` | 1P |
| `camera_3p_tt_runtime` | 7000 | `race_3p_tt_camera.txt` | 3P |
| `camera_dynamic_obstruction_runtime` | 9000 | `adventure_hub_drive.txt` | 1P |
| `camera_obstruction_performance_runtime` | 12500 | `race_4p_split.txt` | 4P |
| `camera_obstruction_lifecycle_runtime` | per-scenario | 3 lifecycle scripts | 1P/2P |
| `camera_snapshot_coverage` | 6400 / 9200 presents | 3 presentation routes | 2P/3P/1P |

`camera_obstruction_lifecycle_runtime`'s `pause-restart` scenario also carries
the number 5200, but those are ticks from `check_presentation_lifecycle.SCENARIOS`
driving `race_pause_restart.txt` — a different subsystem, a different script, no
shared code path. It is a coincidence, not a shared route.

**MERGE CANDIDATE — `camera_obstruction_runtime`'s modern arm into
`camera_obstruction_display_matrix`.** These are literally the same command.
`display_matrix` imports `run()` from `obstruction_runtime` and its
`4:3-high` × `authored` cell is `run(binary, rom, "modern", frames, timeout,
window="1280x960", fov="authored")` — byte-identical to `obstruction_runtime`'s
modern arm apart from `--frames` (3600 vs 5200). Raising that one cell to 5200
frames would let it emit the modern-arm evidence `obstruction_runtime` reports
today. Estimated saving: one 5200-frame 1P run, roughly 20s quiet.

**KEEP-SEPARATE, with the mechanism that forbids merging:**

- `camera_obstruction_runtime`'s `legacy` / `center-ray` / `observe` / `unset`
  arms, plus the reduced-motion `comfort` arm. `MDKR_CAMERA_OBSTRUCTION` selects
  one policy per process. Five policies is five processes; there is no version
  of this that is one pass, and `MDKR_CAMERA_COMFORT` is a sixth for the same
  reason. The `legacy` and `center-ray` arms are **positive controls** that must
  reproduce lens penetration, `modern` is the opt-in witness that must select
  the MODERN gate and actually correct, and `unset` must reproduce `observe`'s
  counters exactly — the assertion that the shipped default is the tested
  default.
- `camera_projection_fallback_runtime` injects
  `MDKR_TEST_CAMERA_PROJECTION_FAIL_TICK=800`. Merging it into any clean-run
  gate would break that gate's "zero penetrated/degraded/invalid on every tick"
  assertion by design, at tick 800.
- `camera_emergency_readability_runtime` injects
  `MDKR_TEST_CAMERA_DISABLE_ALTERNATE=1`, removing an evasion path other gates
  rely on being available. Same conflict. It shares `obstruction_runtime`'s
  route and frame count and *still* cannot share its process.
- `camera_obstruction_performance_runtime` measures p50/p95/p99 off an
  allocation-free clock under `MDKR_CAMERA_PERF=1`. Every other gate in the
  family sets `MDKR_CAMERA_TRACE=2`, which formats a text row every tick. A
  merged process would perturb the exact percentiles it gates. It also asserts
  byte-identical `[SIMHASH]` streams between `observe` and `modern`, and between
  `modern` and `modern` + `MDKR_CAMERA_COMFORT=reduced`, which requires three
  processes anyway.
- `camera_obstruction_lifecycle_runtime` needs process- and level-transition
  seams (quit-to-menu, pause/restart, post-race reload). A single continuous
  headless run cannot produce them.
- `camera_dynamic_obstruction_runtime`, `camera_3p_tt_runtime`,
  `camera_snapshot_coverage` — different routes, different player counts, and in
  the last case a different renderer and `--dump-frames`. A different route is a
  different process regardless of what is measured.

The three `source`-role camera tasks (`camera_track_occlusion_cache`,
`camera_object_occlusion_cache`, `camera_dynamic_occlusion`) launch no engine and
hold no ROM; all three report 0s. They are free and stay.

### 4.3 The presentation family — deliberate duplication, KEEP-SEPARATE

`presentation_breadth` (6m31s), `presentation_matrix` (3m05s) and
`arbitrary_presentation_rates` (56s) do overlap on content and rate. They do not
overlap on assertions, and the overlap is documented in the source as
intentional.

| | rate arms | content | workload | asserts |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `arbitrary_presentation_rates` | original/30/60/90/120/144/165/240/uncapped + display + PAL 25/60 — 21 arms | track 5 only, NTSC + PAL | 21 × 600 ticks = 12,600 | state + event + input + **PCM** byte-identity, exact rational present counts |
| `presentation_matrix` | unset / 30 / 60 only | track 5 + track 26 for particles | ≈91,840 frames over 18 runs | state + event + input + PCM, **plus pixels** (the only one) |
| `presentation_breadth` | 60 (NTSC) / 50 (PAL) only | 17 arms: car/hover/plane, 3 bosses, 4 challenge types, 1P–4P, NTSC + PAL | ≈232,800 frames over 36 runs | **`[SIMHASH]` only** — no event, no input, no PCM — plus presentation-quality telemetry |

The content collisions and why each is not a duplicate:

- `breadth`'s `ancient-lake-car` reuses the matrix gate's baseline route. The
  source says why: *"'standard AI races' + the reference the matrix gate already
  runs, kept so a divergence between the two gates is attributable."* Breadth
  asserts SIMHASH-only there; matrix asserts SIMHASH + EVENTHASH + INPUTHASH +
  PCM + exact packet counters. Same fixture, strictly different question.
- `breadth`'s `challenge-battle-1` (track 26, rate 60) collides with `matrix`'s
  particle arms (track 26, rate 60). Matrix's exist to run a **pixel diff**
  between particle interpolation on and off. Breadth never dumps a frame.
- `breadth`'s three PAL arms collide with `arbitrary_rates`' two PAL arms only
  on track 5. `pal-boss` (38) and `pal-battle` (26) have no counterpart there,
  because `arbitrary_rates` drives track 5 exclusively.

Neither `presentation_breadth` nor `arbitrary_presentation_rates` will silently
skip its region arm — both hard-fail if no PAL ROM is found under `--roms`,
which is why `tools/run_checks.py` lines 646–655 pass `--roms` to them. The PAL
half of breadth is 3 of 17 arms and ≈5% of its frames; PAL is not why breadth is
expensive.

**Verdict: KEEP-SEPARATE on assertions. MERGE CANDIDATE on process count** — see
§6.3. The cost here is 36 + 18 sequential engine spawns, not duplicated
assertions.

`presentation_shadows`, `presentation_lifecycle`, `fixed_tick_schedules`,
`hud_render_authority` and `render_purity` are disjoint by construction: a
shadow-replay rigidity measurement, a lifecycle-transition invariance gate, a
scheduler-authority gate, a HUD/RNG/audio invariance gate, and a skip-render
invariance gate with its own divergence control.

### 4.4 The Taj select family — MERGE CANDIDATE, small payoff

Four manifest tasks run the **same script** with different arguments:

| task | args | spawns | run 1 | run 2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `taj_character_select` | (none) | 9 | 3m34s | 43s |
| `taj_character_select_webgpu` | `--renderer webgpu` | 9 | 11s | 11s |
| `taj_character_select_ultrawide` | `--layout base --aspect 21:9` | 5 | 1m49s | 22s |
| `taj_character_select_pal` | `--layout base --require-pal` | 6 | 2m18s | 28s |

What each argument actually changes:

- `--layout` filters the four retail layouts (`base` 8, `drumstick` 9, `tt` 9,
  `complete` 10). Default runs all four; `--layout base` runs one. So the
  ultrawide and PAL tasks each re-run the `base` layout the default task already
  covers, and neither touches `drumstick`, `tt` or `complete`.
- `--aspect` is the only argument that changes test-side logic: it switches
  `FrameGeometry.for_frame` from an identity scale to the centred-fit
  letterbox/pillarbox math. That math is exercised **only** by the ultrawide arm.
- `--renderer` sets `MDKR_RENDERER` and nothing else. No Python assertion,
  threshold or geometry branches on it.
- `--require-pal` swaps which ROM file boots. No pixel box, threshold or
  geometry is PAL-specific in this file.

There is no expensive Python-side setup to amortise. Cost is per-spawn: 29
engine boots across the four tasks, each running 2250 frames of which the first
~1250 are title-screen navigation before anything under test happens. Merging
the four into one process that loops `(rom × renderer × aspect × layout)` is
mechanically trivial but saves only the Python interpreter starts — the boot
cost is per distinct combination and is unavoidable.

**Verdict: MERGE CANDIDATE for clarity, not for cost.** Estimated saving ~1m on
a quiet host. It was ~7m on the loaded one, which is a fact about the host, not
about the gate.

**One coverage finding falls out of this analysis and is worth more than the
minute.** The oversized-shadow negative control is guarded by
`if layout.name == "base" and args.aspect is None`. Because the ultrawide task
sets `--aspect`, it *skips* that control entirely — it runs strictly less than
the default task's own `base` iteration, plus the letterbox math. That is a gap
to close, not a cost to cut, and it is filed here because the cost analysis is
what surfaced it.

### 4.5 `vehicle_sweep` vs `taj_vehicle_sweep` — KEEP-SEPARATE, and one dead argument

Both run `check_vehicle_sweep.py` over the same ROM-derived 47 legal
track/vehicle pairs. `--taj` adds `MDKR_TAJ_TEST_PLAYER=0`,
`MDKR_TAJ_PHYSICS_TRACE=1`, `MDKR_TAJ_VISUAL_TRACE=1`, `MDKR_FORCE_SHIELD` and a
car-only dash trigger, then requires five extra trace markers on top of every
ordinary per-combo assertion.

The *assertion code* is a superset. The *subject* is not: with
`MDKR_TAJ_TEST_PLAYER=0`, player 0 is Taj, so the base assertions are evaluated
against a Taj-substituted racer, never against the ordinary one. **KEEP-SEPARATE.**

Separately: `tools/run_checks.py` passes `("--taj", "--frames", "5200")`, but
`check_vehicle_sweep.py` line 288 already declares `default=5200`. The explicit
`--frames 5200` changes nothing and can be dropped as noise. Zero seconds saved;
it is listed so the next reader does not assume the Taj arm runs a longer route
than the plain one. It does not.

### 4.6 The build-role duplicates — KEEP-SEPARATE, and not worth touching

Six scripts appear more than once under different build roles: `door_blocks`
(native / release / asan), `raw16_audio` (native / release / asan),
`filename_entry` (native / asan), `widescreen_shadow` (native / asan),
`presentation_lifecycle` (release, full; asan, `--only pause-quit`),
`check_vehicle_sweep` (§4.5).

These look like the most obvious redundancy in the manifest and are the least
worth removing. Each pair proves something the other cannot:
`key_cutscene_once` exists because a "show this once" latch vanishes entirely at
`-O2`; the ASan arms exist because a use-after-free is invisible to a
non-instrumented binary. `presentation_lifecycle_asan` deliberately runs a
strict subset arm (`--only pause-quit`) under ASan — the subset is the point,
because it is the arm with the retained-replay teardown.

Total run-2 cost of every duplicate arm: `door_blocks_release` 8s +
`raw16_audio_release` 4s + `door_blocks_asan` 20s + `raw16_audio_asan` 9s +
`filename_entry_asan` 6s + `widescreen_shadow_asan` 21s +
`presentation_lifecycle_asan` 55s = **2m03s**, 1.5% of the run.

**Verdict: KEEP-SEPARATE.** Different build role is exactly the "different
failure isolation" case, and the entire cluster is under two minutes.

### 4.7 Inside `native_layout`: `track_sweep` ⊂ `vehicle_sweep` — REDUNDANT candidate

`check_native_layout.py` runs a 14-entry `RUNTIME_CHECKS` matrix, each entry an
entire other check re-run against the alignment build. Two of those entries are
`check_track_sweep.py` and `check_vehicle_sweep.py`. From the run-2 log:

```
check_track_sweep:   20 track(s), 5200 frames each, autopilot, vehicle=track default
check_vehicle_sweep: 47 combination(s) over 20 track(s), 5200 frames each, autopilot
```

Same 20 tracks, same 5200 frames, same autopilot, and the 47 legal combinations
include each track's default vehicle. For the question this matrix asks — *does
any route trip `-fsanitize=alignment`* — the track sweep contributes no route
the vehicle sweep does not already drive. Its 20 runs are a strict subset of the
vehicle sweep's 47.

**Verdict: REDUNDANT within the alignment matrix, subject to one check.**
`check_track_sweep.py` makes its own assertion the vehicle sweep does not
(`animation targets initialized=1784, invalid=0`). That assertion is already
made by the standalone `track_sweep` task against `build-rel`. The evidence a
future implementer must produce is: that no assertion unique to
`check_track_sweep.py` is build-type-sensitive, i.e. that running it only on
`build-rel` and not on `build-align` loses nothing. Estimated saving: 20 of 67
sweep runs at the alignment build's measured cost, roughly **3m** today.

---

## 5. Precedent: this cycle has already deleted proven-redundant assertions

Removing an assertion is allowed here, and has been done, when the redundancy is
*proven in the source* rather than asserted. Two cases from this cycle set the
bar.

**The crest factor.** `check_audio_level_reference.py` measures whole-capture
RMS and sample peak. Crest is peak minus RMS. Bounding crest against a baseline
derived from the same capture, with both tolerances at ±1.0 dB, restates the RMS
assertion and can only fail when the peak moves — so the peak is asserted
directly and crest is reported but not bounded:

```python
# check_audio_level_reference.py, assert_crest()
# crest = dbfs(peak) - dbfs(rms), and assert_level already pins dbfs(rms)
# to +-RMS_TOL_DB of the same baseline this crest baseline was derived from.
# With both tolerances at 1.0 dB the crest inequality restates assert_level
# and can only fail when the peak moves, so assert the peak directly.
```

The docstring goes further and shows the removal is safe under the gate's own
control: at +3 dB the crest falls to 10.058 dB while the peak stays bit-identical
at 32768, and it is the RMS assertion that fires. The redundant assertion was
deleted; the number is still printed.

**The mutually-implied scheduler pair.** `harness_utils.py`'s
`completed_tick_conservation()` states one of two equivalent facts:

```python
# With the two checks above, this is equivalent to "exactly one ticket is
# still pending" -- issued=ticks-1 and pending=1 say the same thing here --
# so only one of the pair is stated.
```

The same function records the opposite lesson in the same docstring — the
*reason* the debt bounds are the caller's declared expectation and never read
back out of the run being judged:

> Comparing `lead` against `maxpending` instead would assert nothing: with
> `rebases=0` the trace samples clock-minus-issued at exactly the points that
> set the driver's own pending high-water, so the two sides are the same
> quantity and a 40-tick backlog satisfies the comparison as happily as a clean
> run does.

That is the precedent in both directions. A redundancy proven from the
definitions is deleted. A "simplification" that turns an assertion into a
tautology is a defect, and `e793d6b` was the commit that had to restore three
presentation gates' absolute expectations after exactly that happened.

**The bar for anything in §4 or §6: show the implication, in source, the way
these two do.** No merge in this document has met it yet.

## 6. The long poles

### 6.1 `native_layout` — 36m47s, 27% of a quiet release run

**It is not the build.** The task configures and builds `build-align`
(`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`, `-fsanitize=alignment -fno-omit-frame-pointer`) and
builds one target in `build-asan`. Both directories are repo-relative and
persist. Counting `Building C object` lines between the task banner and the
`Sanitizer fixed/legacy controls` banner:

- run 1 compiled **147** translation units — a near-cold rebuild.
- run 2 compiled **1** (`camera_obstruction_runtime.c.o`).
- Total task time: **37m09s vs 36m47s.**

A 147-file rebuild costs 22 seconds of a 37-minute task. The build is noise.

**It is the runtime matrix.** After three fast legacy controls
(`--legacy-mem02` / `--legacy-mem03` / `--legacy-mem04`, which must each be
*rejected* by the sanitizer), the gate re-runs fourteen entire checks against the
alignment binary, sequentially:

`nav_fixtures`, `attract_demo`, `track_sweep`, `vehicle_sweep`, `adventure_hub`,
`adventure_race_loop`, `trophy_series`, `adventure_two`, `collision_gridmask`,
`race_2p_split`, `race_multiplayer`, `challenge_modes`, `taj_challenges`,
`widescreen_proportions`.

All fourteen are also registered as their own manifest tasks against
`build-rel`. Their combined standalone cost:

| | run 1 | run 2 |
|---|---|---|
| the same 14 checks against `build-rel` (Release) | 7m51s | 7m41s |
| `native_layout` (Debug + `-fsanitize=alignment`) | 37m09s | 36m47s |
| **ratio** | **4.7×** | **4.8×** |

4.7× and 4.8× on two different hosts is a stable structural multiplier, and it
is mostly `-O0`. `-fsanitize=alignment` is a cheap instrumentation; `Debug` is
not.

**Restructuring options.**

1. **Build the alignment tree at `RelWithDebInfo` instead of `Debug`.** The
   suite already does exactly this for its heavier instrumented gate:
   `check_full_ubsan.py` configures `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo` with
   full UBSan and runs six broad routes in 7m25s. `Debug` here is a choice, not
   a house rule. Evidence required before acting: (a) the three legacy controls
   must still be rejected at the new optimisation level — the gate already runs
   them, so it proves this about itself on the first run; (b) all fourteen
   sub-checks must still pass, none of which is the documented build-type-
   sensitive check (`key_cutscene_once` is, and is not in this matrix);
   (c) a measured before/after on one tree.

   **LANDED (2026-08-08).** All three pieces of evidence were produced on one
   tree, same host, same fourteen-check matrix: **36m23s → 9m40s**, PASS, every
   fixed arm clean and every legacy control still rejected — MEM-02 reported
   four alignment findings and MEM-03 two at `RelWithDebInfo`, so the
   instrumentation is intact rather than optimised away. That removes roughly
   27 minutes from every future complete run, and `native_layout` is no longer
   the suite's long pole.
2. **Prune `track_sweep` from the matrix** — §4.7. ~3m today.
3. **Parallelise the matrix.** The fourteen sub-checks run in a plain sequential
   loop with no `-j`, no pool. But several of them write EEPROM
   (`trophy_series`, `adventure_two`, `challenge_modes`, `taj_challenges`), which
   is the same constraint that makes the top-level runner sequential. This is
   the *least* attractive of the three: it would require per-sub-check save-dir
   isolation first.
4. `--quick` already exists and cuts the matrix from 14 checks to 1
   (`widescreen_proportions`). It is an iteration tool. It is not a release
   profile — see §7.

### 6.2 `framed_world_views` — 7m51s quiet, 17m56s loaded

**It builds nothing.** No `cmake` or `ninja` invocation appears in the file; it
resolves `build-rel/mdkr64` and runs it. All cost is engine launches.

**Correcting a premise:** there is no "timeout note" for this gate anywhere in
this tree. The two real numbers are `--timeout`, default **300s**, applied
per-arm inside the script (line 740), and the runner's generic
`DEFAULT_TASK_TIMEOUT = 1800` for role `native`
([`../tools/run_checks.py`](../tools/run_checks.py) line 52) — this task does
*not* get the `BUILDING_TASK_TIMEOUT = 10800` budget, which applies only to
`instrumented` and `layout`. At 17m56s the loaded run used ~60% of its 30-minute
task budget. That is the note worth having, and it did not exist before this
document.

**The arm count.** ≈83 sequential engine launches:

- 9 scenes × (3 WebGPU sizes + 1 GL size) × (fixed, unsafe) = 72
- 3 interpolated-boundary scenes × 1 size × 2 arms = 6
- `track-select-scroll` on WebGPU and GL = 2
- 3 PAL envelope arms (GL, 3 sizes) = 3

PAL is 3 of ≈83 runs. The gate hard-fails rather than skipping if no PAL ROM is
found under `--roms`, which is why `tools/run_checks.py` passes it — but PAL is
not the reason this task is a long pole. Arm count is.

**Restructuring option: arm-level parallelism.** Each arm already runs in
`run_dir = work / label` under a task-scoped `TemporaryDirectory`, with
`save_dir = run_dir / "save"` — **per-arm filesystem isolation already exists**.
The runner's sequential rule is about the shared suite save directory; it does
not constrain what happens inside one task. Evidence required: (a) a repeated
run at the intended concurrency producing identical per-arm verdicts, since
these arms compare pixels and concurrent WebGPU contexts are the obvious risk;
(b) a bound on concurrency that keeps each arm inside its own 300s timeout.

**LANDED (2026-08-08).** `--jobs` (default 4) pools the 72 ordinary arms; the
fixed/unsafe pair a verdict compares is resolved inside one work item, so no
comparison spans the pool, and results are collected in submission order.
Evidence, one tree, same host: **518s → 245s**; two consecutive four-way
verbose runs produced **byte-identical per-arm lines** (68 arms, 46 carrying
measured percentages); and a sequential `--jobs 1` sample of three scenes —
`post-race-framed`, `track-select-zoom`, `post-race-transition`, twelve arms —
reproduced the parallel run's percentages **exactly** (39.2%, 58.9%, 80.0%,
88.3%, 77.5%, 86.9%). Concurrent WebGPU contexts do not move a pixel here.
The PAL, interpolated-boundary, scroll and leak arms stay sequential.

`--scene NAME` and `--interpolated-only` already exist as subset flags.

### 6.3 `presentation_breadth` (6m31s) and `presentation_matrix` (3m05s)

Both are dominated by spawn count × per-arm tick budget, and both run their arms
in a plain `for` loop.

- `presentation_breadth`: 36 subprocess runs (17 content arms × base + high,
  plus a 2-run tenancy control), 4200–4800 ticks each, ≈232,800 frames. GL only,
  **no frame dumps at all** — it compares `[SIMHASH]` rows and telemetry.
- `presentation_matrix`: 18 runs, ≈91,840 frames, of which arm C's particle
  (4×8,400), effect (2×8,240) and deformation (2×6,280) arms are 66,640. Three
  runs are WebGPU and several dump PPMs for the tail window — which is why its
  wall-clock ratio to breadth (0.67) is worse than its frame ratio (0.39).

`presentation_breadth` is the cleanest parallelism candidate in the entire
suite: 36 independent spawns, each with its own `run_dir` and its own
`run_dir/save`, GL-only, no pixel comparison to be perturbed by a concurrent GPU
context.

**LANDED (2026-08-08).** `--jobs` (default 4) runs the arms through a thread
pool and collects results by index, so the printed order is unchanged. Evidence
produced on one tree, same host: sequential **499s**, two consecutive four-way
runs **220s and 220s**, and both parallel logs are **byte-identical to the
sequential log** — same verdict, same per-arm notes, same order. `--jobs 1`
restores the old behaviour. `presentation_matrix` is the same lever with the pixel caveat from
§6.2.

### `ghost_matrix` — LANDED (2026-08-09), the largest single task in the suite

At 16.3 min `ghost_matrix` was the most expensive task in the run, ahead of
`native_layout` (9.1) and `full_ubsan` (7.5). It is 47 independent
(track, vehicle) pairs, each recording a ghost, saving it, and reloading it in
a fresh process. The isolation pooling needs already existed: every pair owns
its save directory (`save_env` per child), its generated input scripts (named
by tag inside the shared `workdir`), and its own child environment, and no pair
writes anything shared.

**LANDED.** `--jobs` (default 4) runs the pairs through a thread pool; results
are collected and printed **in matrix order**, so the output is diffable
against a sequential run. Evidence on one tree, same host:

| run | wall clock |
|---|---|
| sequential (`--jobs 1`) | **16.8 min** |
| four-way, run A | **4:38** |
| four-way, run B | **4:37** |

All 47 per-pair rows are **identical across all three runs** — same verdict,
same detail text, same order — compared with the timing column removed, since
that is the one field concurrency is expected to move. `--jobs 1` restores the
old behaviour.

That is ~11.7 min off the complete suite, taking it from roughly 140 min to
roughly 128.

Neither should be reduced by dropping arms. Breadth exists because the matrix
gate is *"necessary evidence but not sufficient breadth by itself"* — its
docstring says so, and the arms it adds (hovercraft, plane, three bosses, four
challenge types, 4P, PAL) exist nowhere else.

### 6.4 `full_ubsan` (7m25s) and `array_bounds_sweep` (2m25s)

Both configure and build their own instrumented tree, both hold it under
`exclusive_build_dir()` for the task, both suppress compiler output unless the
build fails, and both were flat across the two runs (1.05, 1.01).

| | `full_ubsan` | `array_bounds_sweep` |
|---|---|---|
| build dir | `build-ubsan-full` | `build-ubsan` |
| build type | **RelWithDebInfo** | Debug |
| sanitizers | `undefined,float-cast-overflow` | `array-bounds,pointer-overflow,shift-exponent` |
| build parallelism | `-j{cpu_count}` | `-j{cpu_count}` |
| routes | 6, sequential | 8, sequential + a static class sweep + boundary controls |
| subset flags | `--gl-only` (drops 1 route, changes the config) | `--no-controls` (documented iteration-only) |

Both build directories were warm in both runs, so nearly all of that 9m50s is
route execution. Neither is a strong target: together they are 7.3% of the run,
and `full_ubsan` already demonstrates the `RelWithDebInfo` configuration that
§6.1 recommends for `native_layout`. The one thing to note is that
`array_bounds_sweep` is at `Debug` and might take the same lever — a smaller
version of opportunity 1, worth measuring after opportunity 1 lands.

---

## 7. Tiered profiles, without building a subset trap

A subset that reads like a full run is the failure mode this project has already
paid for: subset batteries hid a broken gate for three days after 1.0, and the
runner grew an explicit `SUBSET` marker in response
([`../tools/run_checks.py`](../tools/run_checks.py) lines 525–542):

```python
if not restrictions:
    return f"complete suite, {count}/{len(CHECKS)} tasks"
return (
    f"SUBSET {count}/{len(CHECKS)} tasks: " + " ".join(restrictions)
)
```

Any tiering proposal must be expressed **through** that mechanism, never around
it. The runner already has every flag a tier needs — `--only`, `--role`,
`--primary-only`, `--skip-instrumented`, `--skip-wasm` — and every one of them
stamps `SUBSET n/135` on the verdict line.

A workable shape, using the measured numbers:

| tier | selection | measured cost (run 2) | verdict line |
|---|---|---|---|
| per-commit | `--primary-only` — roles `source` + `native` + `ctest`, 94 tasks | 10s + 41m59s + 48s = **42m57s** | `SUBSET 94/135 tasks: --primary-only` |
| nightly | `--role` naming every role except `layout`, 134 tasks | 135m06s − 36m47s = **98m19s** | `SUBSET 134/135 tasks: --role …` |
| **release** | **no restriction flags** | **135m07s measured** | **`complete suite, 135/135 tasks`** |

The selections and costs in this table are the 2026-08-05/06 measurement at
135 tasks. Since then the manifest has grown to 204 tasks, so the
release row prints `complete suite, 204/204 tasks` today. The tier *shapes*
still hold; the counts and costs need re-measuring.

Three rules make this safe rather than a trap:

1. **The release gate is the full run.** `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` §2b already
   states that the release run must print `complete suite, N/N tasks`, "which is
   the only form that counts as a full run." Nothing in this document changes
   that. A tier is a fast signal between releases; it is never evidence for a
   cut.
2. **A tier is a named selection, not a new manifest.** If a tier needs a task
   list, it derives it from a manifest role the way the release checklist
   already derives the web lane from `BROWSER_ROLES` — a hand-maintained second
   list is how a gate goes missing.
3. **The complete suite runs before every cut.** The full manifest — 204 tasks
   today, not a pinned number — on the candidate tree, with the verdict line
   pasted into the release record. Read the count off the verdict line rather
   than trusting any figure written in this document. That
   rule exists because a subset battery has already hidden a broken gate here.

The tiering itself saves nothing at release time. Everything in §6 does.

---

## 8. Do not touch

These gates are expensive because expense is what they measure, or cheap and
load-bearing. They are listed so a future pass does not spend time re-deriving
that they are off the table.

**Mutation and fault controls.** Every one of these deliberately breaks
something and requires the gate to notice. A control that never runs is not a
saving; it converts its parent gate into an unfalsifiable assertion.

- `world_fx_capture`'s `matrix-drop` arm; `world_shadows`' resource-failure
  latch arm; `shadow_plausibility`'s `MDKR_TEST_SHADOW_BOGUS_CASTER`.
- `camera_projection_fallback_runtime` (injected latch failure) and
  `camera_emergency_readability_runtime` (forced no-alternate) — both of which
  exist *only* as controls and each of which needs its own process (§4.2).
- `camera_obstruction_runtime`'s `legacy` and `center-ray` positive controls and
  its `unset` default arm.
- `state_hash`'s `MDKR_RNGSEED=legacy` arm; `audio_level_reference`'s
  injected-gain arms; `collision_headroom`'s forced saturation;
  `boost_magnitude`'s perturbed constants; `charselect_motion`'s frozen-frame and
  fast-loop arms; `app_capture`'s `--self-test` mutations;
  `taj_results_portrait`'s ordinary-Diddy negative control; `render_purity`'s
  divergence control; `shadow_stage_reset`'s suppressed-reset control;
  `presentation_breadth`'s tenancy control.
- `native_layout`'s `--legacy-mem02/03/04` arms. These are the only reason the
  alignment matrix means anything, and they are seconds, not minutes.

**`determinism` (25s).** The check exists because headless rendering silently
was not reproducible — `osGetCount()` returned the host clock, so the
character-select animation phase differed on every run: 10 distinct images over
10 runs, median 18.9% of pixels differing. Every frame-comparison gate in the
project, the oracle scoring, and the GL/WebGPU parity scoring all assume what
this gate proves. It is 0.3% of the run.

**`state_hash` (2m26s, ratio 0.90).** The anchor for the instrument every
presentation gate is written against. Its own docstring: *"Every later gate —
render purity, the presentation-rate matrix, catch-up equivalence — is 'this
stream is identical' between two schedules. This check anchors the instrument."*
Its four arms are determinism, presentation invariance, a legacy-RNG divergence
control, and per-field-family controls. Removing any of them makes the identity
assertions in eight other gates vacuous.

**The six `browser`-role tasks (12m56s).** Real-time bound, not CPU bound (§3).
The only way
to make it faster is to drive fewer frames, which is a coverage decision, not an
economy. `browser_taj_persistence` taking *exactly* 3m11s on both a loaded and a
quiet host is the measurement that settles this.

**The 94 sub-minute tasks (20m17s, 15%).** Including all seven `source`-role
audits, which cost 10 seconds in total and include the CI contract, the WebGPU
fault-point census, and the address-domain narrowing audit.

---

## 9. The five opportunities, and what must be proven first

Estimates are quiet-host minutes off the 135m07s release run. Loaded-host
savings are larger and less meaningful.

| # | opportunity | est. saving | evidence required before acting |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `native_layout`: build `build-align` at `RelWithDebInfo` instead of `Debug`. The measured Debug-vs-Release multiplier on the same 14 checks is 4.7×/4.8×; `full_ubsan` already runs full UBSan at `RelWithDebInfo`. | **15–24m** | The three `--legacy-mem02/03/04` controls must still be *rejected* at the new level (the gate proves this about itself on its first run). All 14 sub-checks must still pass. A measured before/after on one tree, both numbers recorded. |
| 2 | `framed_world_views`: arm-level worker pool over its ≈83 launches. Per-arm `run_dir` and `run_dir/save` isolation already exists. | **5m** (13m loaded) | Repeated runs at the chosen concurrency producing identical per-arm verdicts — these arms compare pixels and concurrent WebGPU contexts are the risk. A concurrency bound that keeps every arm inside its own 300s `--timeout`. |
| 3 | `presentation_breadth`: same lever over its 36 spawns. GL-only, no frame dumps, per-arm `run_dir/save` — the cleanest candidate in the suite. | **4m** (12m loaded) | Identical `[SIMHASH]` streams and telemetry verdicts across at least two runs at the chosen concurrency. Confirmation that the PAL arms' ROM handles are per-arm. |
| 4 | `presentation_matrix` (18 spawns) and `camera_obstruction_display_matrix` (24 spawns): same lever, plus folding `camera_obstruction_runtime`'s modern arm into `display_matrix`'s `4:3-high`/`authored` cell by raising it from 3600 to 5200 frames. | **3m** (6m loaded) | As #2 for the pixel-dumping arms. For the fold: a run showing the 5200-frame cell emits every counter `camera_obstruction_runtime`'s modern arm reports today. The `modern` arm is also the opt-in witness (it must select the MODERN gate and actually correct), so folding it out of this gate would take that witness with it. |
| 5 | `native_layout`: drop `check_track_sweep.py` from `RUNTIME_CHECKS`. Its 20 routes are a strict subset of `check_vehicle_sweep.py`'s 47 over the same tracks, frames and autopilot. | **3m** today, ~1m after #1 | That no assertion unique to `check_track_sweep.py` — specifically the animation-target initialisation count — is build-type- or sanitizer-sensitive, i.e. that making it only against `build-rel` loses nothing. Proven the way §5's two cases are proven: from the definitions, in source. |

Combined, without deleting a single gate: **roughly 30–35 minutes off a 135-minute
release run**, and roughly an hour off a loaded one. Every one of them is a
change to *how* a gate runs, not to *what* it asserts.

### 9.1 Task-level pooling (`--jobs`), added 2026-08-12

The runner's sequential rule existed because every task shared one scratch
save directory. `tools/run_checks.py --jobs N` removes that sharing (each
pooled task gets its own `MDKR_SAVE_DIR`/`MDKR_TEST_SAVE_DIR` tempdir) and
pools everything except three disjoint serial classes:

- **`SERIAL_ROLES`** — roles that share one build tree or a fixed local port:
  the instrumented/layout compiles, the wasm module, the port-bound browser
  lanes, and the single broad `ctest` inventory.
- **`GPU_SERIAL_NAMES`** — the native/rom/release/asan checks whose *verdict*
  reads rendered pixels, drives a GPU surface, or opens a WebGPU adapter whose
  census is the result. These flake under parallel GPU contention (§8 / "GPU
  gates need a quiet machine"), so they serialize even though their *role*
  pools. This is the load-bearing distinction: a native/rom/release/asan role
  is a mix — `state_hash`, the `camera_*_runtime` SIMHASH gates, the audio,
  save and input checks are deterministic functions of ROM+input and pool
  safely, while `framed_world_views`, `world_shadows`, the `taj_*` pixel
  gates and the presentation-visual checks do not. The set is curated from a
  read of each script, and `validate_manifest()` re-derives the render-marker
  set from the sources and **fails closed** if a pooled engine check ever grows
  a pixel or frame capture without being listed serial — so a future render
  gate cannot silently rejoin the pool and reintroduce a flake.
- **`SERIAL_NAMES`** — gates whose verdict is a wall-clock or host-load
  measurement (realtime pacing, adopted handoffs, replay-cost ceilings).
  The 2026-08-13 qualification pass extended this set with the
  nanosecond-budget family the first full pooled runs proved out: the
  rollback track/item/vehicle matrices and ASAN rematch, the camera
  obstruction performance gate, and the `rom_free_units` battery (its audio
  sink contract stalls under pool pressure). Their *functional* halves are
  deterministic and would pool fine; their p50/p95/p99 budget clauses are
  host-load measurements, and every one of them failed pooled at `--jobs 6`
  and `--jobs 3` on a quiet 14-core machine (the camera gate by 3.2% at
  three workers after 3x over at six — pure pool pressure). Serial is where
  a budget measurement is meaningful at all.

The serial tail runs alone after the pool drains, so its measurements see a
quiet host. `--jobs 1` is byte-for-byte the historical sequential runner. The
pool is additionally capped to what physical RAM can hold (~2 GiB per worker):
a pooled task can be a full game process and an ASan build's resident set runs
past a gigabyte, and sizing the pool by `--jobs` alone is what let a loaded run
get OOM-killed. This composes with #2–#4 above — those pool arms *within* a
task, this pools *between* tasks; the win concentrates in the long middle of
the manifest where neither role nor name forces serialization.

**Classification (2026-08-13).** An earlier revision had folded all of
`rom/native/release/asan` into `SERIAL_ROLES`, which put 192 of 210 tasks back
on the sequential path and erased the speedup. Restoring the pool for the
CPU-bound members leaves 105 pooled / 105 serial. **Equivalence evidence, same
host, `build-rel`:** `math_rotpy`, `math_tables` (native) and
`asset_swap_invariants` (rom) — all four roles the earlier revision had
serialized — produced **byte-identical** output pooled (`--jobs 3`) versus
serial (`--jobs 1`), down to each check's internal FNV hashes, per-angle
divergence counts, and full 17-line arm body. Record measured before/after
wall-clocks here after each release run.

Two further items, recorded but not costed:

- **`overlay_pause`** moved 1m05s → 4s on an unchanged script. A 16× spread is
  larger than contention comfortably explains; something else is going on and it
  is worth one measurement.
- **`taj_character_select_ultrawide` skips the oversized-shadow negative
  control** (§4.4), because that control is guarded on `args.aspect is None`.
  That is a coverage gap surfaced by a cost analysis, and closing it will make
  the suite slightly slower.
