# Open items

This document was split by subsystem. It is now an index and a redirect;
the entries live under [`open-items/`](open-items/README.md).

[`open-items/README.md`](open-items/README.md) carries the still-open table
and the full by-subsystem index.

## Legacy section anchors

Before the split, every entry below was a section of this file. The table maps
each old section title to where its write-up lives now. Deep links written
against the old `OPEN_ITEMS.md#<section>` anchors do not resolve any more — use
the target column.
