# Release checklist

Run this before every public release. It is ordered so the cheapest gate that can
stop a release runs first. Two of these steps are the ones that keep the project in
the clear legally — they are scripts, not judgement calls, and they fail closed.

Nothing here is optional, and nothing here should be reasoned around. If a gate
fails, the release stops.

## Current candidate status (2026-09-08)

**Not release-ready, but now qualified by execution rather than inspection.**
The complete suite has run against the integrated `int-1.7.0` candidate at
`b6e8ff40`: **267 of 271 tasks passed** in 628m49s, and every one of the four
failures has since been resolved and re-validated. This supersedes the old-source
diagnostic run at `12cab88c` (36/271 failed, 626m50s, exit 1), which qualified no
part of the current tree and should be read only as historical failure evidence.
All 36 of that run's failures remain inventoried in
[the diagnostic failure ledger](open-items/diagnostic-suite-failures.md).

Of the four failures in the qualifying run, three were defects in the gates
rather than in the tree, and all three pass standalone and after the fix:

- `taj_character_select` and `taj_character_select_ultrawide` shared a hardcoded
  90s engine-arm ceiling roughly equal to the heaviest arm's own cost, so
  ordinary load on a shared machine crossed it. Both now run under one named
  budget and pass.
- `full_ubsan` capped its 46-route WebGPU census at 900s. Measured directly
  against the same UBSan binary on an idle machine, that census takes 181s and
  passes with zero faults; the ceiling only ever reported contention. All five
  route budgets now scale through one constant, and the gate passes in 33m46s.

The fourth, `camera_motion_quality`, is a pre-existing finding on the **opt-in**
Modern obstruction resolver, which default play does not run: an unset
`MDKR_CAMERA_OBSTRUCTION` resolves to `observe`. Driving the shipped v1.6.0
binary over the same route reproduces a byte-identical census, including the
single `correction_reengagements=1` that fails the gate, so the candidate
neither introduces nor worsens it. Whether that re-engagement is a defect at all
is a quality judgement section 7.3 reserves for a signed review on device; the
evidence is recorded in
[the A/B](evidence/camera-motion-reengagement-ab-2026-09-08.md).

What still stands between this candidate and a release is owner-side: the four
desktop artifacts, physical device acceptance, and issue #61's Windows/NVIDIA
symptom, which no macOS result can settle. Public issue acceptance is tracked in
[`open-items/github-issues.md`](open-items/github-issues.md).
The workstream inventory, parallel Workshop ownership proposal and competitive
comparison are in [the release work plan](RELEASE_WORK_PLAN.md); that plan does
not replace any gate below.

The native join-editor correction now has a shared production-widget regression
target, `online_join_code_input`, covering editing and CPU draw geometry without
platform/GPU backends. Strict syntax, native optimized/ASan+UBSan compilation,
Windows widget-target cross-compilation and CTest registration are verified;
the assertions remain unexecuted. This does not establish native
multiplayer UX, controller or final-package acceptance.

The native invalid-view recovery candidate now retains takeover based on adapter
ownership, offers a deferred safe exit and does not mistake an owned uninitialized
adapter for an idle chooser. Compile-time policy assertions pass; actual failed-view,
leave/registry-cleanup and next-room behavior remain unqualified. See the
[native multiplayer quality plan](multiplayer/NATIVE_MULTIPLAYER_QUALITY_PLAN.md).
Broader feature ambitions and visual polish do not clear this qualification gap.
The neighboring stale-snapshot correction now ends the old frame after adapter
rebuilds and room actions. Successful/refused retries, re-entry and rendered
scope/focus regressions remain unqualified in that same plan. The adapter-view
fixture now compiles runtime assertions against the actual launcher interface;
those assertions have not executed and do not prove worker/registry cleanup.
The same review now covers word-comparison decisions: one enabled action is
dispatched after UI scopes close, then the caller recomposes next frame.
Phrase verification semantics are unchanged; decision/cancel/rejection and
focus/layout behavioral checks remain required.

A neighboring native shutdown review found that the 10-second retirement drain
could detach workers still using static state. The candidate always joins via
the shared `online_teardown_tracker` after reporting a slow drain. Its focused
thread fixture and production-binding source contract still need execution;
real transport cancellation, responsive exit and registry/global lifetime
qualification remain open. This does not establish a total shutdown deadline.
The shared retirement helper now stores its record before launching, retains
ownership until thread creation succeeds, safely falls back to inline cleanup
on scheduling refusal, and reaps completed handles despite other stalled closes.
Launch-refusal/recovery and repeated-session assertions are added, not executed;
storage-allocation fault injection remains open. Normal Quit now uses a native
closing-only progress surface and polls completed retirement handles after
Workshop work settles, with same-frame engine-handoff suppression. Actual
responsive/slow-close and Workshop-cancellation acceptance remains pending;
transport cancellation and resource-exhaustion behavior are separate obligations.

The next lifecycle candidate includes launcher-owned phone transports in that
retirement barrier, clears borrowed aliases before moving ownership, and observes
the process-wide RTC cleanup future only after both room and phone workers finish.
Cleanup failure is explicit and must prevent a successful exit/relaunch verdict.
New completion/source-contract assertions remain unexecuted. The HTTP transport
also now uses per-BIO cancellation/deadline checks, correct nonblocking TLS retry
semantics and SIGPIPE-safe sends on Linux. Trusted-TLS success/backpressure,
ordinary peer-close behavior, all terminal paths and final-package teardown still
need qualification. First-party room/signaling lookups now share an eight-job
budget, retained through abandoned-result cleanup, and global RTC cleanup waits
for that budget to drain. RAII result ownership and startup-failure handling are
also implemented. New saturation, cancellation, recovery and cross-translation-unit
assertions remain unexecuted. OS resolver cancellation and library-internal lookup
lifecycle qualification remain open; no hard exit deadline is established.

Dependency review found that libdatachannel's final-token destructor could
terminate on cleanup-thread creation refusal. The candidate now reserves two
workers before initialization: cleanup executes on one, and its joining
publisher reports the result only after cleanup-thread completion. Thread
creation/detach is no longer performed by the noexcept token destructor. The
tracked patch and shared helper compile in the optimized and ASan/UBSan native
game and focused fixture; new assertions and real RTC shutdown remain unexecuted. A separate
upstream partial-initialization failure was then traced to stale ready state and
incomplete stage ownership. A new transaction candidate now publishes rollback
before acquisition, tracks selective retirement and refuses a new epoch until
retirement succeeds. The original reserved-job cancellation fixture alone did
not clear that defect. See the [lifecycle follow-up](
multiplayer/NATIVE_MULTIPLAYER_QUALITY_PLAN.md#dependency-cleanup-reservation-and-partial-initialization-follow-up).
The [RTC initialization audit](open-items/native-rtc-initialization-audit.md)
records the implemented PollService/SCTP failure-order corrections and Phone
Party construction-error boundary. Optimized and ASan/UBSan
game/stage/transaction builds pass;
actual fault-injection, retry and global-lifetime qualification remain required.
Queued-work noexcept allocation failures and internal C startup exits remain
separate unresolved classes, not covered by this transaction.
The independent bounded work-admission candidate addresses only RTC-ALLOC-01b
(callable extraction without copying) and -01f (accounting after insertion).
Its optimized game/helper compilation passes; assertions remain unexecuted.
RTC-ALLOC-01a/c/d/e still require coordinated implementation and qualification.
The newer dependent prepared-dispatch candidate implements the accepted-work
portion of -01c: nonallocating continuation, timer ordering, accepted-lane join
and final-owner destruction under an explicit live-epoch contract. Both shared
helper and actual patched-vendor fixtures are registered but unexecuted.
Final optimized, ASan/UBSan and Windows cross-builds compile/link the game,
`datachannel_prepared_work`, `datachannel_prepared_dispatch`,
`datachannel_work_admission` and `character_workshop_model` after correcting the
new fixture's private include paths. All include settled Workshop reinspection
and invalid-height guidance; no new assertions executed. Windows retains a
historical cloud origin, not final partyless artifact provenance. Exact composed scheduler/
Processor/Queue pins and source-form notice gates are updated. Generic allocating
`noexcept`, SCTP refusal ownership and terminal retirement are not cleared.
The subsequent transport-retirement candidate now reserves serial stop/deletion
before construction, coordinates start/stop and exact-owner publication, and
preserves healthy shared-lower ownership when an unstarted candidate loses.
Review also corrected callback/pending lock inversion and retired-capture
destruction under the pending lock. Optimized, ASan/UBSan and Windows cross-builds
compile/link the game, both new actual-vendor fixtures, prepared dispatcher and
Workshop model. The 10 retirement
and 11 edge fixture groups remain unexecuted; real network refusal/recovery and
stop/destructor allocating bodies remain open. See the
[bounded ownership follow-up](open-items/native-rtc-work-admission-audit.md#per-resource-reservation-and-lower-edge-correction-candidate).
Workshop raw blocker navigation also now yields to deletion and Ctrl/Cmd editing
shortcuts, in addition to text/navigation input. Source/model checks and the
three-profile integration compiles do not qualify rendered or controller focus.
Windows retains its historical cloud origin, not final partyless artifact
provenance; BasisU GCC warnings remain unresolved. No apps or tests executed.
The same audit records the in-flight callback publication candidate: generation
and peer-identity checks now protect actual state/event commits after parsing;
unfinished setup and delayed retry/ping/give-up decisions retain their exact
owner and current-state requirements. Shared-predicate and source-binding
fixtures are added, not executed. Real callback interleavings and recovery
remain unqualified; already-admitted RTC I/O is not synchronously cancelled.
Early peer-setup refusal now has bounded autonomous retries: lifecycle-scoped
failure/offer budgets, generation/revision ownership and delayed retry admission
are source-bound to the shared policy. Optimized compilation is not executed
fault/recovery or rendered exhaustion acceptance.
The related native match-signaling worker-start correction restores retryable
Idle state instead of leaving a workerless Connecting client on launch refusal.
Its production-path refusal/retry fixture is implemented but unexecuted;
the [source audit](open-items/native-rtc-initialization-audit.md#rtc-signal-01--native-signaling-worker-start-refusal-poisoned-connecting)
distinguishes that correction from broader running-worker allocation limits.
Mandatory signal close now precedes best-effort rejection-event construction;
reporting refusal cannot strand the joinable worker. Its new actual-client
assertion is compiled, not executed.
The subsequent signal factory/send/reporting candidate adds atomic outbound and
correlation insertion, no sequence consumption on refusal, a retained terminal
fallback, loss-preserving drain preparation and RAII local credential-buffer
erasure on unwind. Final optimized, ASan/UBSan and Windows cross-builds compile/
link the game plus `network_lifetime`, `party_peer_setup_retry`,
`datachannel_work_admission`, `match_signal_client` and `lan_party_server`,
including the latest LAN timeout/capture-retirement follow-ups. Actual refusal/
retry assertions and broader backpressure/caller coverage remain pending. The
Windows profile retains native beta and a historical nonempty cloud origin,
not final partyless artifact provenance. BasisU GCC and libdatachannel
function-cast warnings remain; build success does not clear them.
The [Windows network-lifetime audit](open-items/windows-network-lifetime-audit.md)
records source-confirmed first-party startup/ownership and cold LAN-enumeration
gaps plus their implemented checked shared-lease candidates. Resolver results,
sockets and retained aliases keep their prerequisites; cleanup failure remains
visible in the terminal no-relaunch verdict. Shared-policy/source fixtures are
added, not executed; actual Windows faults and package acceptance remain open.
RTC's own startup/cleanup amendment does not own these references. LAN now has
a separate syntax-checked post-accept/handler candidate: staged ownership and
rollback, common sealed finalization, nonblocking listener and callback-safe
stop requests, checked mandatory timeouts and callback-capture retirement.
Its six actual-server fixture groups remain unexecuted;
exceptional retained join ownership explicitly reports incomplete cleanup.

The integrated callback/signaling/startup checkpoint compiles the native game
and all five affected fixtures (`party_callback_identity`, `match_signal_client`,
`rtc_initialization_transaction`, `datachannel_startup_stages`, and
`datachannel_cleanup_worker`) in optimized and ASan/UBSan profiles. These were
bounded compilation-only runs; no executable assertions, RTC sessions or apps
ran. Python 3.10 AST parsing, strict helper C++17 syntax, affected shell/JavaScript
syntax and whitespace checks pass. Existing dependency CMake warnings remain.

The same graph audit reconciled stale transport notices with the actual
libdatachannel 0.24.5 and libjuice source pins, recorded the previously omitted
plog source amendment and the cleanup patch/helper, and synchronized all three
desktop notice-hash validators. Full license texts remain unchanged. Source
identity, Python AST and shell syntax checks pass; the new notice consistency
regressions, package validators and rebuilt shipping packages have not executed.

The original older-source `widescreen_shadow_asan` check also failed: six timeouts
and missing final shadow reports, with unequal partial trace lengths. Investigate
and rerun on the final candidate; neither sanitizer clearance nor a proven
simulation divergence can be inferred from those incomplete arms. Keep the gate
failing until complete qualifying evidence exists. The reporting candidate now
refuses incomplete parity comparisons and retains optional private per-arm
evidence; new mock assertions are registered but unexecuted. No timeout or route
length was relaxed.

Later observations of that same immutable diagnostic run record passes for
`full_ubsan`, `native_layout` and the engine-independent browser save UI. They
also record browser resource/session/touch/presentation timeouts, three missing
native end-to-end driver artifacts, and several Party Worker startup failures.
These remain separate qualification failures requiring triage; they neither
prove a shared root cause nor qualify the newer integrated source. The existing
run and its private evidence have not been restarted or modified.

The missing-driver triage confirms a runner routing defect: three browser/native
end-to-end checks received no selected build and silently used their standalone
`build-rel` default. They now receive the selected native directory and staged
shell explicitly; preflight requires the corresponding drivers. Standalone
resolution also handles Windows executable suffixes. Mock routing/preflight
regressions are added, not executed. Even the non-executing `--list` attempt was
rejected by the current command control; no alternate entry point was used.
The same sweep also fixed the gallery's separate selected-game-executable route;
it is not a sibling-driver consumer. Mock routing/preflight assertions await
execution for all four native/browser gates.

The seven local Worker consumers now require the lockfile-installed Wrangler
entrypoint during runner preflight, before staged-artifact inspection or suite
subprocesses. Missing-tool guidance names the lockfile and does not install
anything. The embedded-LAN check has no new Worker dependency. Shared startup
keeps ownership until readiness succeeds and attempts cleanup on normal failure,
unexpected exception or interruption. Diagnostic failures do not replace the
original failure class. New routing/admission and mocked process assertions
remain unexecuted.

Worker startup and the two-person/chaos failure boundaries now retain only
allowlisted categories, source locations and bounded private metadata. They do
not copy raw logs, command arguments, response bodies or browser state into the
aggregate report. Chaos retains its whole-log error gate with bounded-memory
scanning. These privacy/reporting changes do not establish the two historical
early-exit causes, successful service behavior or any public deployment.

Browser startup diagnosis now has opt-in bounded phase markers around actual
renderer setup, display-list walking and engine RAF waits, plus an independent
browser RAF heartbeat. Enable only for a diagnostic attempt through test config
`startupDiagnostics: true` or `MDKR_TEST_BROWSER_STARTUP_DIAGNOSTICS=1`; explicit
config `false` wins. Normal play and normal qualification keep the heartbeat off;
native markers compile away. History retains at most 32 events, and heartbeat
observation stops at terminal/pagehide or its observation limit. Timeout snapshots
collect this bounded diagnostic state rather than additional save/ROM data.
These observations do not establish a browser root cause or replace completed
uninstrumented timing/performance gates. JS/Python fixtures and C source bindings
are registered but unexecuted; the instrumented-capable wasm engine compiles and
generated/source JavaScript syntax checks pass. It has not been browser-qualified
or copied into an immutable release stage.

The pacing check now offers `--keep-evidence` for the next authorized diagnostic
run, preserving separate attempt output and process outcomes before parsing.
The original failing companion's temporary trace was deleted; its 43 re-anchors
cannot be explained from the strict run's histogram. Retention tests are added
but unexecuted, and the pacing failure remains open with unchanged thresholds.

The PNG decoder now also carries a small local ownership/early-return amendment
for ordinary bit-depth-conversion allocation failure. This is not an unmodified
upstream header: base and amended hashes are recorded in THIRD_PARTY/NOTICE.
The registered `stb_conversion_ownership` regression uses ordinary pixels and
allocator refusal, not malformed input. Its assertions, old-code control and
final-source sanitizer/fuzz run remain required before release. This amendment
does not clear the broader advisory disposition or change KTX2 qualification.

- **Decoder qualification in progress:** the KTX2/BasisU alignment finding has
  a local amendment applied after upstream source hash verification. KTX2 stays
  enabled. The prior private failing input now passes; a new valid-texture
  regression passes across all four output formats and 16 host alignments under
  ASan/UBSan. Linking the same regression to the original pinned decoder fails
  under UBSan, confirming detection. A fresh ASan/UBSan fuzz run completed
  4,004,077 executions in 601 seconds with no new finding. The known alignment
  defect is fixed in the candidate; exact release-artifact qualification and
  the broader advisory review remain required.
- **Local renderer evidence:** the saved neighboring-gate log records PASS for
  `world_fx_matrix`, `render_purity`, `camera_snapshot_coverage`,
  `split_screen_backdrop`, `split_screen_pause_resolution`, and
  `split_screen_void_coverage`. The void candidate passed 20 US 1.1 arms on
  local shipping-SDL2 GL/WebGPU, including Pure pixel identity and unchanged
  simulation. These are six selected gates, not a full release pass. The log
  contains stale-artifact warnings (including a native binary older than
  `cmake/tests.cmake`); rebuild and requalify the exact final candidate.
  A subsequent native rebuild passes fresh 20-arm US and 20-arm European void
  runs. European witnesses come from a separate dense survey because regional
  gameplay timing differs; both revisions use identical acceptance thresholds
  and broken-render controls. The initial US-timed European probe remains
  recorded as a failed qualification attempt.
- **Acceptance gaps:** Windows/NVIDIA's reported purple viewport is not yet
  proven equivalent to the locally corrected blue obstruction; Windows/package
  launcher proof (#60), physical-controller opponent-skill acceptance (#62),
  broader European revision coverage, and the full release/platform/device matrix
  remain pending. Taj portrait evidence does not implement Dixie, Tiny, or
  NDS tracks (#58); their release scope needs a maintainer decision.
- **Release gates still required:** complete the checklist against final
  artifact hashes and provenance, including current pinned-dependency advisory
  review and Character Workshop acceptance. Saved captures, raw logs, ROMs,
  and private sanitizer artifacts must remain outside the public repository.
  Publishing, pushing, tagging, deploying, and issue closure require explicit
  maintainer approval.

The corrected optimized CTest selection now passes a complete 278/278 run
(excluding `gpu|app_process|browser` labels). The earlier 277-pass run and
obsolete runner-authorization assertion failure remain recorded separately.
The complete CI contract, nine focused optimized units, and three ASan/UBSan
units also passed. These results do not substitute for the unrestricted suite.

Clean-source artifact checkpoint `12cab88c` now has a macOS arm64 DMG that
passes bundle and mounted-copy LaunchServices/WebGPU qualification, asset
absence, and exact checksum/provenance verification. It is ad-hoc signed,
not Developer ID signed or notarized. The packaged launcher-skip gate passes
all nine arms. The clean web build and its prepared local-only payload pass
candidate provenance/source hygiene, real-browser cloud-surface absence,
and save-custody checks; full browser gameplay qualification remains pending.
Native packaging pins now match the reviewed amended BasisU notice on all
three desktop platforms, with a source guard against future drift. Windows
ZIP and Linux tarball packaging self-tests pass, but fixture archives and
Windows cross-compilation are not Windows/Linux release-package acceptance.
Private logs, artifacts, and hashes are retained outside the repository.

The unrestricted 271-task run at `12cab88c` exposed a runner qualification
defect: sixteen engine-using tasks were classified `rom` and did not receive
the selected native binary, so they used an absent default build instead.
The candidate runner now routes those tasks through `native` and forwards
the ROM-revision directory to the ROM-checker page gate. CI also checks that
declared artifact flags receive the selected paths, including missing/wrong
path controls. The failed run is retained; a new complete run with the
corrected runner is required before claiming suite qualification.
Its native CTest phase separately reported 320/321 passing: the lobby-takeover
script passed seven active views, but CMake still required nine after two
obsolete selection previews were retired. The candidate corrects that stale
success count without changing the application's behavioral assertions.
The actual lobby CTest and complete CI contract now pass; three mutation
controls reject stale counts, inventory drift, and a removed success predicate.
The corrected CI contract and four focused routing checks (`subentry_bounds`,
`input_hotplug`, `rom_checker_page`, `a11y_shell`) pass. The latter is explicitly
`SUBSET 4/271`, not a replacement for that complete run.

The diagnostic run also fails `camera_motion_quality`: one Ancient Lake
correction re-engagement and one 3P+T.T. continuous-surface shoulder-flip report.
Fresh level-2 traces reproduce both. Measurement review finds that the latter's
side label changes while the published pivot-relative eye
and forward direction remain effectively fixed. A subsequent census correction
separates this held-eye/reference-axis crossing from actual shoulder flips.
The 3P rerun reports zero flips and one separately visible basis crossing, with
all 20,463 published camera-observation rows unchanged. Optimized and sanitizer
units retain genuine switch detection, including slow/deadband crossings;
controls reject both the old miscount and suppressed real flips. Ancient Lake's
re-engagement remains a hard failure. That measurement correction did not change
the camera resolver, release-hold timer, or motion thresholds.
The complete three-route/240 Hz rerun confirms that Ancient Lake re-engagement
is the remaining hard failure; the hub and 3P routes report none.
Source audit separately finds that the documented proportional expansion bound
in camera architecture section 7.3 is not implemented: recovery has speed and
absolute-step caps, but no 25%-of-remaining-error cap. That calibration and
coverage gap remains open; changing recovery alone has not been shown to fix
Ancient Lake, and no hard motion assertion has been waived.
The candidate now retains level-1 re-engagement event context per arm, including
release/gap and last/current contact evidence. `camera_motion_reporting` adds
ROM-free reporting regressions, including failed authored/high-rate arm
isolation. Compilation and parser checks pass; new tests and route execution
remain pending. This is diagnostic work, not a fix for the hard failure.

A separate source-backed pause defect is corrected in the candidate: zero-time
camera revalidation no longer consumes release-hold ticks. The runtime supplies
zero elapsed time while paused; previously repeated clear queries could retire
the hold before any authored time advanced. Regression cases now cover every
point in the hold, projection changes, exact resume timing, and immediate
contact retraction even at zero time. This does not change the configured hold
duration or establish a fix for Ancient Lake. Behavioral qualification and the
original hard motion route remain required.

The older diagnostic run also fails `pacing_quality`: the final non-strict
companion retry reports 43 slot re-anchors against a budget of 3. This is not
a missing-display-baseline exemption, and the cause is not yet established.
Its failure report printed only the strict arm's distributions, so those
numbers must not be attributed to the failing companion. The candidate now
retains each companion attempt's own measurements and retry notes, with a
registered reporting contract awaiting execution. Both realtime paths now share
mandatory run-identity, no-tearing, no-underrun and no-backward-phase checks
before any missing-baseline exemption, with regression cases pending execution.
No pacing threshold, retry
budget or product pacing behavior was changed; the failed gate remains open.

New pre-release issue #63 has a source-confirmed trophy-domain defect:
Future Funland (world 5) was excluded by the helper shared by trophy awarding
and cabinet/model display, despite having its own saved two-bit field. The
candidate corrects that bound and adds unit/production-series coverage; runtime
award, persistence, reload, cabinet/Tracks display, no-downgrade and Adventure
Two/final-package acceptance remain pending. See [the #63 backlog entry](
open-items/github-issues.md#63--future-funland-trophy-missing). No automatic
achievement grant or save-format change is part of this correction.
The related sweep also corrects false gold from OR-merging medals across saves
and limits the T.T. trophy counter to five fields. Optimized and sanitizer
game/unit compilation pass; executable regression and negative-control checks
remain pending. See [the trophy-domain audit](open-items/trophy-domain-audit.md).

Linux x86_64 Release compilation now passes at `ba620a1b` in an isolated,
two-CPU Ubuntu 22.04 container, with KTX2 and online beta enabled and the
cloud origin empty. This follows explicit camera-pointer and diagnostic-format
maintenance; first-party warnings remain errors. The Linux frozen Workshop
importer and validator now verify, and the importer's offline lifecycle passes.
The first ROM-free CTest attempt exposed a Python 3.10 parser incompatibility
in a verbose save-check diagnostic; the candidate fixes it without changing
the check's assertions. All 433 tracked Python files then parse under 3.10,
and the save-directory isolation scanner passes. That CTest attempt was also
interrupted by its container's normal build-workflow exit. The complete rerun
at `9e8e034d`, with CI-pinned Python and Node, finishes 275/278 passed:
`online_live_adapter` and `online_live_matrix` fail assertions, and
`match_live_transport` terminates with a segmentation fault. These blocked
qualification at that checkpoint; the latter also reproduced in isolation. Packaging
correctly stops. Sanitizer diagnosis identifies an unseeded WebSocket random
generator on plaintext loopback connections. The candidate seeds it before
either plaintext or TLS use; macOS transport tests, including a fresh-nonce
reconnect regression check, pass. Linux optimized/sanitizer confirmation is
now complete at `46e6643f`: three consecutive optimized runs and the full
transport suite under ASan/UBSan pass. Leak checking was not enabled in the
emulated container. Packaged-launcher qualification remains pending.
Container evidence cannot establish physical
Linux GPU acceptance. Existing `12cab88c` macOS/web artifact identities remain
unchanged and must not be relabeled as this later source checkpoint.

The two adapter tests also assumed endpoint A wins asynchronous preflight,
although their two endpoints share a once-only process-global engine roster.
The harness candidate requires exactly one installer, both peers' agreed
descriptor, and the winning peer's actual local-seat/viewport mapping. Its
deterministic checks cover either winner and reject absent, duplicate, or
wrong-owner installs. The macOS adapter, impairment matrix, route, and repair
lanes pass (646 assertions total). This
does not change production installation or race-convergence behavior.
The complete selected Linux ROM-free rerun at clean `5fc099fc` passes 279/279
tests in 178.83 seconds. Both endpoints are observed winning installation with
matching runtime ownership. Four built-launcher arms (WebGPU, OpenGL, Online
Room, Play) also pass under Mesa/Xvfb. The first strict packaging attempt stopped
on a missing container extraction dependency. After adding it, the full rerun
passes 279/279 again and produces both AppImage and tarball. All four packaged
launcher arms pass from the extracted tarball. The AppImage's 44 shared payload
entries match that qualified tree in bytes, modes, and symlinks; its only extra
entry is the expected desktop-icon link. The outer AppImage runtime was not
executed under emulation. No tar-only release waiver was used. These artifacts
are private `5fc099fc` evidence, not the later PNG-hardening candidate.

A subsequent defensive PNG-writer admission change checks packed RGB/RGBA
layout against the pinned encoder's internal size calculations before export
or capture encoding. It retains ordinary 4K/8K/16K layouts and does not change
the encoder or decoder pins. Allocation-free boundary tests, small RGB/RGBA
roundtrips, optimized and ASan/UBSan units pass; a control with the former
positive-size-only admission fails the new boundary check. Texture-export
integration and the complete Workshop preview/capture gate also pass, including
RGB gameplay and transparent RGBA capture. Final-platform/artifact reruns and
the broader advisory disposition remain required.
Its full Linux build also exposed a GCC dataflow warning for the PNG job-layout
temporary; initialization is now explicit and warnings remain errors. The new
clean Linux `72770712` build and qualification pass: 280/280 selected tests
(179.87 seconds), four built and four tarball-packaged launcher arms, strict
AppImage/tarball packaging, and 44-entry shared payload parity. Those artifacts
include the PNG hardening but precede the lobby CTest-contract correction.
Outer AppImage runtime/hardware acceptance and the final-source full matrix
remain pending; private artifact hashes are recorded with the evidence.

The next source candidate makes texture-pack PNG header admission mandatory:
failed inspection cannot enter pixel decoding, and decoded dimensions must
match the admitted header. Regression coverage reuses the existing unreadable
header case and ordinary small-image fixtures, with test-only returned-metadata
controls for width/height disagreement. Strict compiler checks and bounded
native compilation pass; these updated behavioral checks have not run.
This first-party hardening does not change the decoder pins, close the pending
advisory review, or qualify the earlier packaged artifacts as this new source.
All four first-party PNG caller limits now have compile-time conversion-size
guards. Current limits compile under native Clang and Windows GCC; four
deliberately oversized-limit source controls fail at the intended assertions,
without executing a decoder or allocating image buffers. The limits and
runtime behavior are unchanged by these guards. Private advisory review now
distinguishes a reported missing check already present in this pin from
size-conversion concerns constrained by caller admission. The older general-
loader disposition and final-candidate behavioral qualification remain open.

A later candidate applies the cited upstream integration's empty-allocation
defense at the first-party PNG decoder allocator. Refused resize retains the
original allocation; positive-size requests and image limits are unchanged.
The texture-store probe shares these helpers, and `png_write_layout` adds
small ownership/growth/shrink cases alongside ordinary PNG roundtrips. Native
optimized and ASan/UBSan compilation, strict C syntax and decoder-configuration
preprocessing pass; no new test/decoder execution occurred. Vendored header
hashes are unchanged. This is a candidate mitigation, not final disposition
of the broader general-loader advisory. The complete caller inventory and
remaining gates are in [decoder boundaries](security/image-decoder-boundaries.md).

Clean macOS Debug compilation at `c522ebae` now completes with shipping SDL
2.32.10, KTX2 and online beta enabled, and the cloud origin empty. Its detached
source remains clean, and the build stamp and binary hashes are recorded in
private evidence. The game and two PNG unit targets also compile with
ASan/UBSan instrumentation at this source checkpoint. Neither compilation result
is a new behavioral or sanitizer-test pass. The complete Debug matrix and the
new PNG admission regression/control runs remain required. The older `12cab88c`
diagnostic suite has separately passed camera snapshot coverage and arbitrary
presentation-rate checks; those results do not qualify this newer source.

A complete Windows cross-build at that checkpoint exposed three test-target
portability failures: a missing process-ID declaration, insufficient isolation
of the production void walker at link time, and SDL entry-point remapping in a
stubbed window-policy unit. It also diagnosed an out-of-bounds write in the
input-repair test fixture itself. The candidate fixes those harness/build
issues without changing product behavior or dropping tests. The full Windows
cross-build now completes, including all unit executables; a strict compiler
control rejects the old fixture and accepts the bounded replacement. The four
affected unit targets also compile in native optimized and ASan/UBSan builds.
The complete incremental Windows build also passes at `c701145d`, including the
zero-time camera release-hold correction. Its existing cloud-enabled developer
profile is not the final partyless package. These are compile/link results, not
Windows runtime, GPU, package, or controller acceptance; behavioral checks for
the changed units remain pending.

Fresh Linux x86_64 Release compilation at clean `da4d9924` now passes all default
targets, including the later PNG admission and zero-time camera corrections.
Its read-only source checkout remains unchanged; the binary contains the exact
candidate build stamp. KTX2, native online beta and GPU test inventory are
enabled, with the cloud origin empty. This is a new compilation-only result,
not a rerun of the earlier Linux CTests, launcher checks or package qualification.

The web engine also compiles at `c701145d`, including the later PNG admission,
caller-limit guards, and zero-time camera correction. Generated JavaScript
passes syntax checking, and the
WebAssembly module passes structural validation with the compiler's required
features enabled. Private hashes bind this incremental compilation evidence;
browser gameplay, staged-payload provenance, and final web acceptance remain
pending. Neither build executes its resulting game or test binaries.

The later incremental web build also includes the local PNG conversion-failure
amendment. Its generated JavaScript passes `node --check`; the wasm passes
`WebAssembly.validate` without module instantiation or execution. Private
hashes identify the same-link JS/wasm/symbol-map triple. KTX2 remains enabled,
native app and online beta are disabled, and no `dist/web` payload was staged
or published by this check. Browser gameplay/save/recovery, exact staged-payload
provenance and the final clean-candidate web gates remain required.

Source review found a separate Windows workflow predicate bug: portable-mode
read-back used regex brackets where the application prints literal brackets.
The candidate uses an exact whole-line fixed-string match against the fresh
read log. CI controls cover the old regex, partial-line matching, and the wrong
log. YAML/Python parsing and embedded-shell syntax checks pass; the new contract
controls and actual Windows persistence workflow have not been executed.

## 0. Prerequisites

You supply your own legally-owned ROM. It is never committed.

Follow the maintainer's current `AGENTS.md` validation policy. On 2026-09-06
the maintainer gave standing authorization for this workstation, including
behavioral, native, GPU, browser, ROM, and compiled tests. That authorization
permits supplying `MDKR_DEDICATED_TEST_DESKTOP=1` to the existing runners;
no additional confirmation each turn is required. The suite inherits the flag
and refuses execution without it; `--list` remains a non-executing exception.
Hidden-window hints alone do not authorize another machine. Prefer low-priority
builds and bounded concurrency.

When running from the private assembly checkout, refresh the separate public
source branch first:

```bash
git fetch public main
```

`tools/ci/check_release_ready.sh` audits `public/main`'s complete reachable
content history in that checkout, while continuing to audit the exact candidate
tree at `HEAD`. In a normal clone of the public source repository, both checks
use `HEAD`. New outgoing commits are additionally checked one by one by the
pre-push and hosted CI gates, including content committed and later deleted.

```bash
ln -s /path/to/your/baserom.us.v80.z64 baserom.us.v80.z64
```

## 1. Clean-room verification

The claim in [`../DISCLAIMER.md`](../DISCLAIMER.md) and [`../NOTICE.md`](../NOTICE.md)
is that no ROM or bulk ROM-derived assets are in this repository or its history.
A ROM committed and then deleted in a later commit is still in every clone
forever, so a working-tree check alone does not prove this. The release-readiness
guard separately pins the narrow deleted-screenshot exception recorded in
`NOTICE.md` to an exact historical path list and rejects any new media path.

```bash
tools/check_clean_room.sh
```

Expected: `check_clean_room: PASS`. It checks, and fails closed on:

| # | Check |
|---|---|
| 1 | No `.z64`/`.n64`/`.v64` is tracked |
| 2 | No ROM-extension path was ever added in any commit on any ref |
| 3 | No blob anywhere in history carries an N64 ROM header at offset 0, in any of the three byte orders |
| 4 | No blob in history is implausibly large for source (4 MiB backstop for ROM-derived bulk under an innocent name) |
| 5 | No emulator source is vendored — the visual oracle patches ares out-of-tree, under git-ignored paths |
| 6 | `.gitignore` still covers ROMs in all three byte orders, saves, and captures |

Step 4 reports rather than fails: brand art and generated lookup tables legitimately
exceed the threshold. **Confirm each reported blob is first-party or documented in
`NOTICE.md`** — do not wave it through.

Also confirm by eye that no oracle capture escaped: captures are `*.ppm` under
`build/ares-oracle/`, and `MDKR_AUDIO_DUMP` writes a RIFF/WAVE file of synthesised
game audio, which is ROM-derived output.

```bash
git status --porcelain --ignored | grep -iE '\.(ppm|wav|raw|z64|n64|v64)$' || echo "no stray captures"
```

## 2. Build clean — **both configurations**

Use a clean candidate checkout and fresh build directories for qualification;
do not overwrite artifacts or build trees belonging to an active run. The
native profile below enables the shipping online beta and KTX2 decoder, while
registering the GPU tests needed later in this checklist. The bare development
preview stays disabled; the beta composes its required panel internally.
The empty cloud origin matches the current deliberately partyless candidate.
If a cloud-enabled candidate is approved, use its exact recorded origin in all
three native builds and their packaged artifacts. Keep the web's local-only
profile separate. On macOS, first select the pinned shipping SDL2 prefix via
`PKG_CONFIG_PATH`, as described in section 2b.

```bash
release_native_args=(
  -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
  -DMDKR_ENABLE_GPU_TESTS=ON
  -DMDKR_ENABLE_ONLINE_BETA=ON
  -DMDKR_ENABLE_ONLINE_ROOM_PREVIEW=OFF
  -DMDKR_CHARACTER_KTX2=ON
  -DMDKR_PARTY_ORIGIN=
)
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug "${release_native_args[@]}" &&
  nice -n 15 cmake --build build --parallel 2
cmake -S . -B build-rel -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release "${release_native_args[@]}" &&
  nice -n 15 cmake --build build-rel --parallel 2
cmake -S . -B build-asan -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug "${release_native_args[@]}" \
  -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-fsanitize=address,undefined -g -O1 -fno-omit-frame-pointer" \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-fsanitize=address,undefined -g -O1 -fno-omit-frame-pointer" \
  -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS="-fsanitize=address,undefined" &&
  nice -n 15 cmake --build build-asan --parallel 2
```

Expected: `[100%] Built target mdkr64`, no new warnings, from all three.
Check the generated compile and link commands: both C and C++ must carry
ASan/UBSan in the sanitizer build, including the custom-character decoder.
Compilation alone does not qualify any behavioral or sanitizer gate.

The web link additionally treats every wasm-ld warning as fatal, and all
Clang/Emscripten translation units reject implicit function declarations. One
toolchain diagnostic remains expected when `--emit-symbol-map` asks Binaryen
`wasm-opt --print-function-map` to print rather than write a file:
`warning: no output file specified, not emitting output`. It originates in the
required same-link crash-symbol-map step, not in project code; any other web
warning fails this gate.

**Why both, every time.** `CMakeLists.txt` defaults native to **Debug** and the web
build to **Release**. So the configuration players actually run in the browser is
the one the native suite never exercised — and that is not hypothetical: two
player-reported bugs (the world-key cutscene replaying after every race, and Taj's
OFFERED flag never being written) were *created by the optimiser* and were invisible at
`-O0`. A progress flag written as `FLAG << (i + 31)` is undefined in C, always folds to
zero at `-O2`, and clang deletes the load, the test and the store together, so both
halves of a "show this once" latch vanish at once. Every native check stayed green
throughout.

A probe run at `-O0` says nothing about a defect whose mechanism *is* optimisation.
When a report comes from the browser and reproduces nowhere, build Release natively
**before** assuming the difference is wasm.

## 2b. Run the complete native suite against the optimised build

Every behavioural check now accepts the same `--build` contract: either a build
directory or its `mdkr64` executable. The runner knows which checks require the
selected, Release, ASan, self-built UBSan, or wasm artifact; it also fails if a new
`tests/check_*.py` is absent from its manifest, or if a `tests/test_*.py` has no
CMake `add_test()` to carry it into the ctest task.

Build the web artifact first (section 4's `tools/web/build_web.sh`), then run the
suite **once, with no subsetting flags**. Every
`--only`/`--role`/`--primary-only`/`--skip-*`
restriction makes the runner label its verdict `SUBSET n/N`; the release run must
print `complete suite, N/N tasks`, which is the only form that counts as a full
run.

```bash
tools/web/build_web.sh          # builds, stages dist/web, runs the guard itself
python3 tools/run_checks.py --jobs 6 --require-shipping-sdl --require-fresh \
  --build build-rel --release-build build-rel --asan-build build-asan \
  --wasm build-web/mdkr64_web.wasm
```

`--require-fresh` refuses an artifact older than a source file it is built from.
Without it the runner prints `STALE ARTIFACT ... Rebuild before trusting this
run` and then runs anyway, which is not a warning a ten-hour release run can act
on: the 2026-09-08 qualification of `b6e8ff40` carried a `build-asan` binary two
days older than `platform/mod_texture_store.h`, so the fourteen tasks that take
the ASan role reported on a tree the candidate no longer was. A release run has
no reason to accept that, and the flag existed before this was written down.

`--require-shipping-sdl` makes preflight refuse a binary linked against
Homebrew's `sdl2-compat` shim. The releases bundle the pinned upstream SDL2
(`macos/Scripts/build_release_sdl2.sh`; configure with `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`
pointing at its `install/lib/pkgconfig`), and the two libraries differ in
unfocused-joystick delivery: the 1.6.0 qualification once went green under the
shim on a lane that is red under the shipping library. Every run also prints
`run_checks: sdl flavor: …` so a plain developer run still records which one it
measured.

`--jobs` pools the CPU-bound work — the `source` checks and the native/rom/
release/asan checks whose verdict is a deterministic function of the ROM and
inputs (audio, save, state-hash, input, rollback, numeric camera geometry,
progression). Three classes stay serial and run after the pool drains:
build-tree- or port-sharing roles (`ctest`, the instrumented/layout compiles,
the wasm module, and every browser lane — `SERIAL_ROLES`); the render/GPU
checks whose verdict reads rendered pixels or drives a GPU surface, which flake
under parallel GPU contention (`GPU_SERIAL_NAMES`); and the wall-clock/host-load
measurement gates (`SERIAL_NAMES`). Those three sets in the runner are the
authority. `validate_manifest()` fail-closes if a pooled engine check ever
grows a pixel/frame capture without being listed as serial, so a new render
gate cannot silently rejoin the pool. The pool is additionally capped to what
physical RAM can hold (~2 GiB/worker) so a high `--jobs` cannot OOM the host.
Each pooled task gets its own scratch save directory, so the historical
"several checks share `save/eeprom.bin`" constraint no longer forces the whole
manifest through one lane. A `--jobs` run is still the complete suite: the
verdict line stays
`complete suite, N/N tasks`. If any pooled task fails in a way that smells
like host contention rather than a code defect, re-run that task alone
(`--only <name>`) before treating it as a regression — the same discipline
the GPU-labelled ctests already require.

The complete suite requires an authorized dedicated test desktop. The
`rom_free_units` task runs all registered CTests without a label exclusion;
GPU-labelled native-window tests are registered only when the build enables
`MDKR_ENABLE_GPU_TESTS`. A release owner with authorization for GPU tests
registers and runs that lane explicitly on the dedicated desktop:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build-rel -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DMDKR_ENABLE_GPU_TESTS=ON
env MDKR64_HIDDEN=1 MDKR_AUDIO=0 \
  SDL_MAC_BACKGROUND_APP=1 SDL_WINDOW_NO_ACTIVATION_WHEN_SHOWN=1 \
  ctest --test-dir build-rel -L gpu --output-on-failure --no-tests=error -j1
```

`MDKR64_HIDDEN=1` and SDL's `SDL_MAC_BACKGROUND_APP=1` and
`SDL_WINDOW_NO_ACTIVATION_WHEN_SHOWN=1` hints remain mandatory defense in
depth. They do not guarantee focus isolation or authorize execution on an
occupied workstation. Local CI's optional ordinary CTest lane excludes
`gpu|app_process|browser`; the complete suite runner does not.

`check_key_cutscene_once.py` is the one check that is **build-type-sensitive by
design**. The runner verifies that its dedicated binary has an optimized
`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`; it also verifies that the filename-entry sanitizer binary
actually imports ASan. The ROM-free CTest task includes the display/runtime/
layout/scheduler units, the deterministic audio queue controller, and SDL's
silent queue-mode sink contract. When explicitly selected, native launcher GPU
tests share one CTest resource lock. A release evidence record must state that
this opt-in lane ran; workstation-safe validation reports it as excluded and
never implies coverage.

The RAW16 gate repeats against primary, Release, and ASan artifacts. The
specialized native-layout gate verifies linked
ASan/alignment handlers and exact legacy controls, then runs the complete
menu/track/vehicle/Adventure/boss/2P/widescreen matrix under halt-on-error
alignment UBSan. The primary suite's seven-arm `check_widescreen_proportions.py`
pixel-measures SAFE_2D and world-space golden balloons at two deterministic
approach frames across 4:3, 16:9, 21:9, and changed FOV, with exact legacy
stretching as its failing control.

`check_native_ui_resolution.py` runs GL/WebGPU production and disabled-control
arms, requires the HUD/minimap-only pixel delta and measured edge gain, and
rejects any world-after-overlay draw or pass-start failure. The 2P/3P/4P gates
extend that ordering assertion to every viewport layout.

`check_door_glyphs.py` drives a fresh Adventure save into Dino Domain on GL and
WebGPU, proves the four 1/2/3/5 race doors share one cached model, and requires
the material-bound texture offset to remain per door while the camera moves.
Its shared-offset counterfactual must disagree, so the gate detects the 1.0.1
camera-dependent numeral regression rather than passing on route reachability.
In Original presentation mode it also rejects blank output, requires visibly
distinct 2/1/3 glyphs, and compares final door pixels from GL and WebGPU. This
catches per-texture sampler state being skipped when OpenGL changes texture
objects, which otherwise stamps repeated numerals across the wood. Synthetic
blank, common-glyph, and repeated-sampler controls must all fail the pixel gate.

`check_video_options.py` runs both native backends and requires every in-game
control, atomic fresh-process reload, override locking/no-bake behavior,
unwritable-storage rollback, and malformed-launcher no-rewrite behavior. The
real-browser gate repeats the menu mutation and IDBFS reload in wasm.
`check_audio_options_persistence.py` separately requires the original Audio
Options sliders to commit before exit, then injects an unwritable destination
and proves the visible retry/session-only decision path.

## 3. Behavioural regression suite

Run every primary behavioural check against Debug as the second configuration.
The specialized Release/ASan/UBSan arms already ran in section 2b.

```bash
python3 tools/run_checks.py \
  --build build --primary-only --skip-wasm
```

See [`../tests/README.md`](../tests/README.md) for every assertion, positive
control, and frame budget. The optimized and Debug invocations are both required:
the former catches optimizer-created defects, while the latter is the everyday
developer configuration and can expose different layout/timing failures.

Do not add `--expect-fail 9`: the historical level-9 failure no longer reproduces
and both math arms complete that track. Keeping the stale exception would allow a
new regression on exactly that track to pass the release gate.

## 3a. Realtime pacing measurement — prepared machine, human present

The suite runs `pacing_quality` with `--allow-no-baseline`: its automation
windows render occluded by doctrine, and an occluded (or session-less) window
cannot measure displayed intervals — macOS throttles its presents. The
realtime arms therefore downgrade to loud notes in-suite, and the measurement
this section owns has to happen once per release on a machine that can
actually present:

1. Log in, unlock, leave the desktop clear (nothing covering the window that
   opens), and keep hands off for the run.
2. ```bash
   MDKR_TEST_VISIBLE_HEADLESS=1 python3 tests/check_pacing_quality.py \
     --build build-rel --rom baserom.us.v80.z64
   ```
3. Require the full PASS — no `--allow-no-baseline`, no downgraded notes.
   This is the only coverage the alpha-grid projection has anywhere.

## 3b. Independent real-ROM gameplay oracle

The in-process deterministic suite proves that presentation choices do not alter
the port's own state. This separate local-only gate compares authored gameplay
against the US 1.1 ROM running in the pinned, instrumented ares build:

```bash
tools/prepare_ares_oracle.sh
tools/run_oracle.sh bluey2_state_oracle \
  --native-bin build-rel/mdkr64 --native-arm original
```

Expected: `compare_oracle_state: PASS`. Both runners must finish, reach the same
lap and checkpoint, retain at least 95% checkpoint/lap agreement, and keep
position p95 within 200 world units. Do not use the Enhanced one-field arm as
the reference. Since the boss-cadence governor of 2026-08-09 (issue #26) it no
longer reproduces the historical boss-speed error on defaults —
`check_bluey2_rematch.py` now requires the Enhanced arm to finish inside the
Original band, and the pre-governor runaway is reproduced only under
`MDKR_BOSS_CADENCE_COMPAT=0`.

Run `python3 tests/check_bluey2_rematch.py --build build-rel --rom <owned ROM>`
as the progression-valid, audio-bearing standing gate. The measured release
closeout and timer-sampling explanation are in
[`BLUEY2_PARITY.md`](BLUEY2_PARITY.md).

The broader Ancient Lake `race_state_oracle` is a divergence-onset diagnostic
(`state_classification: diagnostic` since 2026-08-25) for longstanding
open-loop floating-point drift, as documented in
[`ORACLE.md`](ORACLE.md); it reports threshold observations and exits clean
rather than presenting as a failing parity gate, and it is not a substitute
for this passing cadence gate.
For a change which intentionally touches gameplay math or authority ordering,
record before/after Ancient Lake reports as differential evidence — its
unchanged strict thresholds define what an observation is, so do not loosen
them.

### Menu navigation fixtures

The nine `nav_*` fixtures, three repetitions each, on a **clean EEPROM** (a recorded
time changes the menu route):

```bash
release_smoke_save="$(mktemp -d)"
MDKR_AUDIO=0 MDKR_TRACE=1 MDKR_SAVE_DIR="$release_smoke_save" \
  ./build/mdkr64 --headless-frames 1700 \
  --input-script tests/input_scripts/nav_to_options.txt \
  --rom baserom.us.v80.z64 2>&1 | grep 'menu_init: menuId=12'
```

Per-fixture frame budgets and expected assertion lines are tabulated in
[`../tests/README.md`](../tests/README.md). A run fails on a non-zero exit, a
`[CRASH]` backtrace, a `[FATAL]` abort, or a missing assertion line.

> **Do not assert with `printf ... | grep -q` under `set -o pipefail`.** `grep -q`
> closes the pipe on its first match, the upstream `printf` takes SIGPIPE (141), and
> `pipefail` reports the *successful* match as a pipeline failure — inverting every
> assertion in the harness. Match with bash `case "$out" in *"$want"*)` instead.
> This cost real debugging time; it looks like a total regression.

## 4. Web build and the artifact ROM-absence gate

Section 2b's single full invocation already ran every web task. This section is
the artifact gate plus, for iteration only, a way to re-run just the web lane
without naming its members:

```bash
tools/check_no_rom.sh dist/web
# iteration only -- the release evidence is section 2b's complete-suite run
python3 tools/run_checks.py \
  --role wasm,browser,browser_save,browser_local \
  --wasm build-web/mdkr64_web.wasm \
  --rom baserom.us.v80.z64
```

Expected: `check_no_rom: PASS — N artifact(s) scanned, no ROM data present.` and
every selected runner task PASS. `--role` selects the web lane out of
`tools/run_checks.py`'s own manifest, so this list cannot drift from the tasks
that actually exist — the Taj character-select and persistence gates joined the
`browser` role and are picked up without editing this document. The runner
prints the count it selected and labels the run `SUBSET`.

`check_wave_visible_table.py` is the one check that can only be run on the **web**
artifact: it catches a linker layout split that the native target is immune to by
luck, and which crashed a player in the browser. Do not skip it because the native
suite is green — the native suite passes either way. See
[`../tests/README.md`](../tests/README.md#wave-visibility-table-layout--testscheckwavevisibletablepy-run-this-after-any-wavesc-or-link-flag-change).

`check_browser_runtime.py` then runs that artifact through the committed shell in
an isolated real Chromium profile. It must reach a race for 3,600 paced frames,
render five changing scenes, survive three live CSS/DPR resize transitions, feed
the AudioWorklet, report nonzero fixed-mode RAW16 loads in its first active
block, maintain measured event-queue headroom, restore the exact ROM and EEPROM
after reload, exercise both erase controls, and observe no request that could
upload or name the ROM. The manifest also passes `--camera-obstruction modern`,
so the first document must publish Modern camera telemetry on nearly every
opportunity with nonzero applied corrections and zero penetrated, invalid,
degraded, or capacity-failed results. This is the reproducible browser-runtime
evidence; the post-release check below remains a human packaging/hosting check.
It also requires exactly one authored NTSC realtime pace initialization, no
update or wall-field count below two, a 24–36 FPS median complete-loop cadence,
and post-startup cadence no worse than 40.0 ms p95 / 45.0 ms p99. These are
the default Original/authored-motion baseline. It also fails if an async
pipeline takes more than two
authored render frames. An incomplete pipeline must skip the host opportunity
until a new authored image is ready; the release path may not replay or swap the
last image as a duplicate. The raw maximum and its frame number remain visible
in the PASS line.

`check_browser_presentation_rates.py` independently exercises display, numeric
caps, irregular display schedules, and the browser's documented uncapped
fallback. It must preserve the same fixed-authority state, gameplay-event,
consumed-input, and PCM hashes across those host schedules. Interpolated arms
must perform real immutable replay, publish true forward task data, resolve
private-arena and copied-external dependencies, and account for every submitted
or nonblocking-held surface opportunity without a runtime GPU wait.

`check_browser_resource_plateau.py` separately performs four real wasm race
loads through production pause-menu restarts. It must prove stable warmed
game/audio ownership, exact voice/state conservation, coherent non-growing
WebGPU generations, and zero terminal host/frontend/backend/AudioWorklet
ownership.

`check_browser_save_ui.py` is the fast player-data custody gate. It deliberately
removes WebGPU, never selects a ROM, and proves that the save module remains
independent of the engine. It checks exact raw/container export, hostile and
oversized input, all injected IDBFS transaction failures, safe metadata preview,
corrupt-block recovery, block merge, one-field edit containment, keyboard/screen
reader semantics, complete wipe→real-file import→reload, and zero uploads. The
Pages workflow runs this gate again before an artifact can be deployed.

This is **the** legal gate on a shipped build. It is structural, not a string
search: header magic at offset 0 in all three N64 byte orders, plus the big-endian
magic sequence anywhere in each file (which catches a ROM baked into the wasm). The
engine legitimately contains ROM validation strings, so a name search would
false-positive; see the comments in `tools/check_no_rom.sh`.

The guard refuses to pass vacuously — an empty target directory is a failure, not a
pass. Confirm the file list it prints is what you expect to publish, and that
`mdkr64_web.js` / `mdkr64_web.wasm` are present in `dist/web` but **not** tracked in
git.

## 4b. Custom Character Workshop release evidence

Section 2b's unrestricted suite is also the automated release gate for the
Custom Character Workshop. Its log must contain passing roster, live identity,
collection-flag, raw-intake, history, draft-transfer, Portrait Studio,
test-evidence, and exact-renderer-preview tasks. A focused rerun is useful while
fixing a failure, but its `SUBSET` verdict never replaces the complete-suite
record.

Before publishing any build that exposes the Workshop:

- [ ] Run **Custom Character Workshop acceptance** in
      [`RELEASE_CANDIDATE_TEST_GUIDE.md`](RELEASE_CANDIDATE_TEST_GUIDE.md) on
      the exact packaged candidate, not a source-tree executable.
- [ ] Complete its mouse, keyboard, controller, touch, app-spoken-guidance, 200%
      scale, narrow-layout, reduced-motion, and colour-vision matrix. Do not
      record spoken guidance as screen-reader compatibility. Record
      `not available` honestly where a platform lacks a modality; do not turn
      an unobserved cell into a pass.
- [ ] Exercise clean install, offline relaunch, disable, rebuild/update,
      last-known-good recovery, portable export/review, and permanent removal.
      The user's original model and license must remain outside application
      custody and unchanged.
- [ ] Capture select plus car, hovercraft, and plane evidence for floor,
      facing, seat, contacts, pose transitions, occlusion, and the complete
      1P-4P cost matrix. Retain privacy-bounded profiles from representative
      low-, mid-, and high-tier physical WebGPU devices. Record every
      amber/error row; a local performance exception is evidence, not a
      manufactured pass.
- [ ] Verify both a native mixed-direction name and a missing-glyph fallback,
      including their keyboard/spoken-guidance descriptions and exact live
      roster pixels.
- [ ] Verify the package contains the HarfBuzz and SheenBidi notices alongside
      the importer, validator, BasisU, and meshoptimizer notices. Keep the
      character model, ROM, saves, screenshots, and device-profile exports out
      of the public release archive.
- [ ] At the candidate cut, review the exact pinned Basis Universal/KTX-Software
      commit and vendored `stb_image` commit against their upstream security
      advisories and the CVE database. Record the query date, immutable pins,
      findings and disposition in private release evidence; do not substitute
      an unpinned update or claim that an offline build performed this review.
- [ ] Run the ASan+UBSan custom-character MDKC/KTX2 fuzzer from
      `tests/README.md` against a copy of its deterministic corpus. Preserve and
      regress any crash before release; a time-bounded clean run supplements,
      but never replaces, the structural unit and package gates.
      **Local decoder qualification passes:** the alignment amendment passes
      its sanitizer regression and 4,004,077 fuzz executions over 601 seconds.
      Final-artifact qualification remains; prior unit passes alone do not
      clear this gate for another build.
- [ ] Validate the completed privacy-bounded receipt against the exact artifact
      and provenance bytes. A template is intentionally red until every
      required observation is replaced:

      ```bash
      python3 tools/check_character_release_evidence.py \
        character-acceptance.json --artifact-dir /path/to/candidate-artifacts
      ```

Record the candidate commit and artifact hash, package/source digest, platform,
GPU/driver, output/render size, input/accessibility modalities, completed
contexts, evidence-report hash, and first failed step. Screenshots and model
captures may contain user-licensed or ROM-derived pixels: retain them as private
acceptance evidence unless their redistribution rights were reviewed
separately. The receipt schema is
[`ref/mdkr-character-release-acceptance-v1.schema.json`](ref/mdkr-character-release-acceptance-v1.schema.json);
archive the validator's receipt SHA-256 with the release decision.

## 5. Desktop packaging and publication

Desktop workflow version inputs are filename components, so public releases use
bare semantic versions such as `1.7.0`, never `v1.7.0`. The `v` prefix belongs
only to the Git tag. For version 1.7.0, the portable workflow must produce:

- `Golden-Balloon-1.7.0-linux-x86_64.AppImage`
- `Golden-Balloon-1.7.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`

Each portable artifact must have adjacent `.sha256` and `.provenance.json`
sidecars. The checksum file contains exactly the artifact SHA-256 and basename,
so it remains usable after all three files are downloaded into one directory.

Automatic Windows publication is intentionally disabled for this release because
`windows-latest` does not guarantee a qualifying D3D12/Vulkan adapter or GL 3.3
context. Its headless `--help`/`--video-list` execution is not accepted as a
rendered launcher or gameplay gate. The workflow still builds, unit-tests,
import-checks, packages, extracts, and launches `GoldenBalloon.exe` from an
unrelated CWD.

The exact-manifest `Golden-Balloon-1.7.0-windows-x64.zip` may be attached only
after manual acceptance on Windows hardware proves the extracted package can:

1. open the real launcher through default WebGPU;
2. load the supported ROM and complete the release gameplay checklist;
3. receive controller input and produce audio;
4. save and reload settings plus EEPROM data; and
5. exit and relaunch cleanly.

Record the tester, Windows version, GPU, archive SHA-256, and outcome with the
release. Publish the exact checksum-verified archive and provenance sidecars:
its `.sha256` and `.provenance.json` files
that were accepted; never substitute or rebuild it afterward. Explicit GL is a
diagnostic follow-up, not a prerequisite for endorsing the WebGPU-default
Windows artifact. This is a manual native GPU acceptance boundary, not an
automated GPU-qualification claim.

Use `version=dev` only for disposable test artifacts, never for a public
release; `release_tag` must then be empty. A semantic-version build requires the
exact `v<version>` tag, and that tag must resolve to the workflow's source
commit. The tagged dispatch belongs to the exact assembly sequence below; do
not dispatch it from a moving branch or before the candidate tag exists. The
workflow must reject every other input shape, compile that exact
value into both validation binaries, and compare each binary's `--version`
output before packaging. The Windows zip's exact payload remains
the `GoldenBalloon/` directory containing `GoldenBalloon.exe`, `LICENSE`,
`README.md`, `RUN_ME.txt`, and `gamecontrollerdb.txt`; no DLL or unlisted entry
is permitted. The Linux
tarball's exact payload is `Golden-Balloon.AppDir` with the launcher, desktop
metadata, icon, license, README, controller database, internal `mdkr64`
executable, and exactly one SDL2 runtime. Each packager verifies the archive it
actually wrote.

The Linux job must use Xvfb plus Mesa's pinned lavapipe ICD/llvmpipe software
stack to render and content-validate both default-WebGPU and explicit-GL
launcher captures before packaging. It must then extract the tarball, resolve
its bundled SDL2, change to an unrelated CWD, launch through `AppRun`, and repeat
both capture/content gates. The ROM-free CTests and asset-free verifier must
pass in the same job before the Linux artifacts are uploaded. If any part of
that job fails or is unavailable, publish no Linux artifact and do not attach a
locally produced replacement under the canonical release filenames.

Before creating the release tag, put the exact behaviorally qualified candidate
on public `main`, check it out cleanly, and run the external repository gate:

```bash
tools/manual/check_github_launch_ready.sh --repo akratch/goldenballoon
```

Expected: `GitHub public readiness passed`. Do not tag or dispatch a release
while it reports `[FAIL]`. This is the authoritative gate for public repository
settings and surfaces that source CI cannot prove, including branch protection,
Actions SHA-pin enforcement and retention, security endpoints, stale public
commit references, workflow artifacts, protected release/Pages environments,
and release-asset sidecars. `macos-release` must require an environment reviewer
and permit only branch `main` plus tag `v*`; `github-pages` must permit only tag
`v*`. Review every
warning explicitly even though warnings alone do not fail the command.
Hosted workflow paths are compared in full. The exact GitHub-managed
`dynamic/dependabot/dependabot-updates` path is accepted only while the source
tree tracks `.github/dependabot.yml`; every other untracked or moved workflow
still fails closed.
GitHub's immutable closed-PR refs may sit outside rewritten `main` only when
their exact ref and full SHA appear in
`tools/public_retained_ref_allowlist.tsv`; every listed commit's complete
reachable history has passed the current public-surface policy. A new or moved
PR ref, any mutable branch/tag ref, and stale workflow runs still fail closed.
For canonical desktop artifacts, the gate uses GitHub's authoritative asset
SHA-256, downloads only the small adjacent sidecars, and rejects checksum byte
mismatches, dirty or wrong-commit provenance, wrong 1.7 Phone Party/signing
modes, and orphan sidecars. For every 1.7+ release it also requires both Linux
formats, Windows, at least one recognised macOS DMG, and one Phone Party mode
across every platform sidecar.
Sidecar filenames alone are not release evidence.

### macOS 1.7.0 — unsigned/ad-hoc release artifact

The public 1.7.0 macOS artifact intentionally skips Developer ID signing and
notarization. “Unsigned” in its filename means there is no trusted signing
identity: the app must still have a valid inside-out ad-hoc integrity seal. The
only expected first-launch interruption is macOS's unidentified-developer
warning; a “damaged” warning is always a release failure.

The exact public files are:

- `Golden-Balloon-1.7.0-macos-arm64-unsigned.dmg`
- `Golden-Balloon-1.7.0-macos-arm64-unsigned.dmg.sha256`
- `Golden-Balloon-1.7.0-macos-arm64-unsigned.dmg.provenance.json`

The provenance sidecar must name that exact DMG, the exact 40-character source
commit, version `1.7.0`, platform `macos`, the DMG SHA-256, and
`macos_signing: ad-hoc-unsigned`. It must also record `phone_party: partyless`
or `phone_party: cloud-enabled`, exactly matching the release workflow's gated
origin decision; an origin-less artifact must never claim cloud capability.

Before producing the candidate:

- [ ] The source tree and index are clean.
- [ ] `CMakeLists.txt`, `macos/Resources/Info.plist`, the app's `--version`
      output, and the release notes all agree on `1.7.0`. Both desktop producer
      workflows independently reject a release-version input that differs from
      the checked-out `CMakeLists.txt` authority.
- [ ] Linux, Windows, and macOS release workflows explicitly enable
      `MDKR_ENABLE_ONLINE_BETA`; the resulting launcher exposes **Online Room**,
      while the published browser payload remains local-only.
- [ ] The release commit is the intended `v1.7.0` tag commit. A test artifact
      may omit `release_tag`; an artifact may be published only with
      `release_tag=v1.7.0` resolving to the workflow's exact source commit.
- [ ] The pinned standalone SDL2 build is used for arm64/macOS 13. Homebrew
      `sdl2-compat`, SDL3, Homebrew load paths, mixed architectures, and a
      deployment target newer than 13.0 are release blockers.

Build and validate a non-publishing candidate through the protected workflow:

```bash
gh workflow run macos-release.yml --repo akratch/goldenballoon --ref main \
  -f version=1.7.0 \
  -f trusted_signing=false
```

Record the resulting run as `MACOS_TEST_RUN_ID`; require its source SHA to be
the same clean public-main candidate before accepting any result:

```bash
MACOS_TEST_RUN_ID="replace-with-exact-run-id"
gh run watch "$MACOS_TEST_RUN_ID" --repo akratch/goldenballoon --exit-status
test "$(gh run view "$MACOS_TEST_RUN_ID" --repo akratch/goldenballoon \
  --json headSha --jq .headSha)" = "$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
```

The package job must complete all of these checks before its artifact is
accepted:

- [ ] Build SHA-pinned standalone SDL2 2.32.10 for arm64/macOS 13.
- [ ] Build `Golden Balloon.app` with `--strict-deployment-target`, embed version
      `1.7.0` and the exact source commit, bundle SDL2, then seal nested code
      before the outer app.
- [ ] Run `verify_asset_free.sh`, `verify_gatekeeper_bundle.sh`, and
      `verify_unsigned_release.sh`. The last check must prove the ad-hoc seal,
      version/commit identity, bundled SDL2 license, WebGPU default launch,
      launcher pixel output, and no SDL3 or Homebrew runtime load.
- [ ] Create the exact `-unsigned.dmg`. `create_dmg.sh` must pass `hdiutil
      verify`, mount the finished image read-only, and revalidate the packaged
      app from that mount. Then `verify_unsigned_dmg.sh` must mount it read-only
      again and pass the full LaunchServices/WebGPU smoke against the packaged
      app itself.
- [ ] Stamp `ad-hoc-unsigned` provenance and emit the matching `.sha256`
      sidecar. Its record must use the DMG basename, not a build-directory
      prefix, so `shasum -a 256 -c FILE.dmg.sha256` works after both files are
      downloaded into the same directory.

For a local reconstruction of those same build and verification steps, use the
commands in [`../macos/README.md`](../macos/README.md). Do not replace its
pinned SDL2 prefix with a machine-local Homebrew package.

### Exact tag, draft release, and artifact assembly

Do not start this sequence until the entire behavioral matrix, the unsigned
macOS test artifact above, and the pre-tag public GitHub readiness gate have
passed against one clean commit. Keep the GitHub Release as a draft until every
required platform artifact below is present and verified. The established
release tags are signed annotated tags; preserve that boundary:

```bash
RELEASE_SHA="$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
test "$(git rev-parse public/main)" = "$RELEASE_SHA"
git tag -s v1.7.0 "$RELEASE_SHA" -m "Golden Balloon 1.7.0"
git tag -v v1.7.0
git push public refs/tags/v1.7.0
test "$(gh api repos/akratch/goldenballoon/commits/v1.7.0 --jq .sha)" = "$RELEASE_SHA"

gh release create v1.7.0 --repo akratch/goldenballoon \
  --verify-tag --draft \
  --title "Golden Balloon 1.7.0" \
  --notes-file RELEASE_NOTES.md
```

Dispatch the qualified portable workflow from that tag:

```bash
gh workflow run release.yml --repo akratch/goldenballoon --ref v1.7.0 \
  -f version=1.7.0 \
  -f release_tag=v1.7.0
```

Record the run ID shown by GitHub Actions as `PORTABLE_RUN_ID`; never use an
unqualified "latest artifact" download. Require the run to succeed at the
release commit, then download its Linux and Windows artifacts into separate
empty directories and re-run the shared provenance verifier. Each invocation
names every required primary artifact explicitly, so a valid sidecar for only
half of a promised platform set cannot make the download pass:

```bash
PORTABLE_RUN_ID="replace-with-exact-run-id"
PHONE_PARTY_MODE=partyless # or cloud-enabled: match the workflow's gated output
RELEASE_STAGING="$(mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/golden-balloon-1.7.0.XXXXXX")"

gh run watch "$PORTABLE_RUN_ID" --repo akratch/goldenballoon --exit-status
test "$(gh run view "$PORTABLE_RUN_ID" --repo akratch/goldenballoon \
  --json headSha --jq .headSha)" = "$RELEASE_SHA"
gh run download "$PORTABLE_RUN_ID" --repo akratch/goldenballoon \
  --name Golden-Balloon-1.7.0-linux-x86_64 --dir "$RELEASE_STAGING/linux"
gh run download "$PORTABLE_RUN_ID" --repo akratch/goldenballoon \

)
RELEASE_ID="$(gh api repos/akratch/goldenballoon/releases/tags/v1.7.0 --jq .id)"
EXISTING_ASSETS="$(gh api --paginate \
  "repos/akratch/goldenballoon/releases/$RELEASE_ID/assets?per_page=100" \
  --jq '.[].name')"
for upload_path in "${LINUX_UPLOAD_PATHS[@]}"; do
  upload_name="$(basename "$upload_path")"
  if [[ ! -f "$upload_path" ]]; then
    echo "required local release file is missing; refusing upload: $upload_path" >&2
    exit 1
  fi
  if printf '%s\n' "$EXISTING_ASSETS" | grep -Fqx "$upload_name"; then
    echo "release asset already exists; refusing upload: $upload_name" >&2
    exit 1
  fi
done
gh release upload v1.7.0 --repo akratch/goldenballoon \
  "${LINUX_UPLOAD_PATHS[@]}"
```

Do not use `gh release upload --clobber`: duplicate names are a stop condition,
not permission to replace qualified bytes. Preserve the downloaded Windows
directory unchanged through the real-hardware acceptance above. Only after it
passes, upload that exact zip and its two sidecars:

```bash
test "$(gh release view v1.7.0 --repo akratch/goldenballoon \
  --json isDraft --jq .isDraft)" = true
WINDOWS_UPLOAD_PATHS=(
  "$RELEASE_STAGING/windows/Golden-Balloon-1.7.0-windows-x64.zip"
  "$RELEASE_STAGING/windows/Golden-Balloon-1.7.0-windows-x64.zip.sha256"
  "$RELEASE_STAGING/windows/Golden-Balloon-1.7.0-windows-x64.zip.provenance.json"
)
RELEASE_ID="$(gh api repos/akratch/goldenballoon/releases/tags/v1.7.0 --jq .id)"
EXISTING_ASSETS="$(gh api --paginate \
  "repos/akratch/goldenballoon/releases/$RELEASE_ID/assets?per_page=100" \
  --jq '.[].name')"
for upload_path in "${WINDOWS_UPLOAD_PATHS[@]}"; do
  upload_name="$(basename "$upload_path")"
  if [[ ! -f "$upload_path" ]]; then
    echo "required local release file is missing; refusing upload: $upload_path" >&2
    exit 1
  fi
  if printf '%s\n' "$EXISTING_ASSETS" | grep -Fqx "$upload_name"; then
    echo "release asset already exists; refusing upload: $upload_name" >&2
    exit 1
  fi
done
gh release upload v1.7.0 --repo akratch/goldenballoon \
  "${WINDOWS_UPLOAD_PATHS[@]}"
```

Publish the unsigned macOS artifact into the existing draft by dispatching the
same tagged source commit with its binding enabled:

```bash
gh workflow run macos-release.yml --repo akratch/goldenballoon --ref v1.7.0 \
  -f version=1.7.0 \
  -f trusted_signing=false \
  -f release_tag=v1.7.0
```

The publish job must independently re-check the tag/commit binding, checksum,
exact artifact name, provenance fields, and provenance digest before uploading
to the existing draft `v1.7.0` GitHub Release. It preflights all three target
names before the first upload and must reject an absent, already-published,
prerelease, or colliding target rather than exposing a partial release.

Before publishing the draft, compare its complete asset inventory with the
twelve exact artifact/sidecar names, then re-run the public GitHub gate so the
new release metadata and sidecar contents are checked too:

```bash
printf '%s\n' \
  Golden-Balloon-1.7.0-linux-x86_64.AppImage \
  Golden-Balloon-1.7.0-linux-x86_64.AppImage.sha256 \
  Golden-Balloon-1.7.0-linux-x86_64.AppImage.provenance.json \
  Golden-Balloon-1.7.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz \
  Golden-Balloon-1.7.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz.sha256 \
  Golden-Balloon-1.7.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz.provenance.json \
  Golden-Balloon-1.7.0-windows-x64.zip \
  Golden-Balloon-1.7.0-windows-x64.zip.sha256 \
  Golden-Balloon-1.7.0-windows-x64.zip.provenance.json \
  Golden-Balloon-1.7.0-macos-arm64-unsigned.dmg \
  Golden-Balloon-1.7.0-macos-arm64-unsigned.dmg.sha256 \
  Golden-Balloon-1.7.0-macos-arm64-unsigned.dmg.provenance.json \
  | LC_ALL=C sort > "$RELEASE_STAGING/expected-assets.txt"
gh release view v1.7.0 --repo akratch/goldenballoon \
  --json assets,isDraft --jq '.assets[].name' \
  | LC_ALL=C sort > "$RELEASE_STAGING/actual-assets.txt"
diff -u "$RELEASE_STAGING/expected-assets.txt" "$RELEASE_STAGING/actual-assets.txt"
test "$(gh release view v1.7.0 --repo akratch/goldenballoon \
  --json isDraft --jq .isDraft)" = true
tools/manual/check_github_launch_ready.sh --repo akratch/goldenballoon
gh release edit v1.7.0 --repo akratch/goldenballoon --draft=false --latest
```

Any mismatch leaves the release in draft. Do not delete, replace, or rebuild an
artifact to make the list pass; diagnose the exact failed producer or acceptance
record and repeat that lane from the unchanged tag.

### Optional trusted macOS artifact

The credentialed path is not part of the unsigned 1.7.0 release. If it is used
later, its exact artifact name is
`Golden-Balloon-1.7.0-macos-arm64-signed-notarized.dmg`, with matching
`.sha256` and `.provenance.json` sidecars and
`macos_signing: developer-id-notarized`. Dispatch with
`trusted_signing=true`; the workflow must Developer ID-sign with Hardened
Runtime, notarize and staple the app, sign and notarize the DMG, require
Gatekeeper acceptance, and still enforce `release_tag=v1.7.0` against the exact
workflow commit before publication. There is no release-approved skip-notary
path.

- [ ] After the final Developer ID signatures and stapling, launch the exact
      signed app through LaunchServices and require WebGPU-default startup,
      four successful surface presents, a pixel capture, canonical clean
      AppHost telemetry, and no Homebrew/SDL3 runtime loads. Static Gatekeeper
      acceptance and the pre-sign unsigned smoke do not satisfy this gate.

## 6. Web publication

Publishing is `workflow_dispatch`-only, by deliberate maintainer decision — it never
fires on push, tag or schedule. The workflow re-runs the size budget, ROM-absence
guard, browser save-custody gate, and tracked-ROM check as their own red steps,
so the release does not depend on a script the build could have skipped.
It also refuses every branch, raw commit, moving `main`, and stale tag: dispatch
the exact project-version tag only, after that tag is bound to the qualified
candidate:

```bash
gh workflow run web-demo.yml --ref v1.7.0
```

The tag-binding step must report `web deployment bound to v1.7.0 at <SHA>`,
where `<SHA>` is the same qualified commit recorded by the desktop artifacts.
The next gate must confirm that `v1.7.0` is already the latest published,
non-prerelease GitHub Release; a pushed tag, draft, prerelease, or older
published tag cannot update or roll back the production site. The deploy job
repeats both state and latest-tag checks immediately before calling Pages, so a
release withdrawn or superseded while the build runs also fails closed.

Before dispatching:

- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` updated, and accurate — no capability claimed that the suite
      above does not demonstrate.
- [ ] `README.md`'s status table still matches measured reality.
- [ ] `LICENSE`, `NOTICE.md`, `DISCLAIMER.md` still describe what is actually in the
      tree. In particular, if a directory changed provenance, `NOTICE.md` must say so.
- [ ] Version tag agrees with `CHANGELOG.md`.

## 7. Post-release spot checks

For the concise human route, use
[`RELEASE_CANDIDATE_TEST_GUIDE.md`](RELEASE_CANDIDATE_TEST_GUIDE.md). Record the
candidate's exact source commit and hashes in the acceptance result; the
artifact sidecars remain the source of truth. The steps below are the
policy-level detail behind that guide.

Load the published page in a WebGPU browser, select a ROM, and confirm it boots and
renders. Confirm in devtools that no request carries ROM bytes — the ROM is read
client-side and must never be uploaded.

Download a save backup, erase stored progress, import the downloaded file, and
confirm the preview is correct. In a browser/profile without WebGPU, confirm that
the same save controls remain available while **Play** is blocked.

For macOS, download the published DMG onto a machine without the build tree or
Homebrew SDL libraries, verify its `.sha256`, mount it, copy `Golden Balloon.app` to
`/Applications`, and launch it without renderer overrides. Confirm the ROM-free
launcher renders through WebGPU, first launch produces at most the expected
unidentified-developer warning, and Finder never reports the app as damaged.
