# The native app shell

`platform/app/` is the in-process launcher, settings UI and in-game overlay for
the native builds. It is ported from the sister **mgb64** project's `src/app/`
(the established backflow practice — see [MGB64_BACKFLOW.md](MGB64_BACKFLOW.md))
and adapted to this game.

Native only. The browser build keeps its own JS shell (`dist/web/index.html`),
which already provides a launcher, ROM picker and settings surface there; the
wasm target is compiled with `MDKR_APP=OFF` and links no ImGui.

---

## How it decides what to do

The shell owns `main()`. `platform/main_pc.c`'s original `main()` is renamed to
`mdkr64_headless_main()` under `-DMDKR_APP` and is otherwise untouched.

The routing rule is **deny by default**: the launcher opens only for a bare
invocation (no arguments) or an explicit `--ui`. *Anything* else — one flag, a
positional ROM, a flag invented next year — delegates verbatim to
`mdkr64_headless_main()`.

This is deliberately inverted from mgb64, which keeps an allow-list of
automation flags and routes everything else (including `--rom`) into a launcher
it then seeds. That is the riskier direction here: this project's harness is
CLI-first, with roughly 197 `--rom` call sites across `tests/`, `tools/` and
`.github/`, many combining `--rom` with flags that are not obviously
"automation" (`--video-list`, `--video-set`, `--pure`, `--window-size`,
`--renderer`). One missed entry in an allow-list silently opens a window inside
a headless gate and hangs it. Deny-by-default makes "no existing invocation
changes behaviour" a property of the rule instead of a property of the list
being complete.

The cost is real and accepted: mgb64's direct-launch seeding (`--rom X` opening
a launcher pre-filled with `X`) is **not** ported. Here `--rom X` still means
"boot this ROM now", which is what every script and user already expects.

---

## Window and device handoff

The launcher creates the window and, on WebGPU, the device/surface. Pressing
Play registers them (`platform/host_window.c`) and then runs the ordinary engine
boot path by synthesising the argv a user would have typed
(`platform/app/engine_boot.cpp`). The engine adopts what it is given instead of
creating its own, so the game continues in the *same* window — the launcher does
not close and reopen.

At engine shutdown, an adopted window is released but never destroyed: the shell
is still running and owns it.

The window is created in the durable `Window.Mode`. Fullscreen uses SDL desktop
fullscreen plus an explicit borderless flag, which covers the current display
without leaving Windows decorations or switching the display mode. Settings
queues a mode change until the next pre-frame event-pump boundary so WebGPU
never changes the drawable after acquisition. F11 and Alt+Enter take the same
transactional path; a platform or save failure leaves/restores the old mode.

---

## Renderer handoff verdict

**WebGPU with Restored presentation is the qualified native visual path; both
launcher handoffs and overlays are exercised on macOS.** GL remains explicitly
selectable for diagnostics while its scene-parity work continues. Remastered is
opt-in work in progress, not a qualified visual path until its visual gates
close:

| Surface | WebGPU (native default) | GL diagnostic (`MDKR_RENDERER=gl`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Launcher UI | `gfx_webgpu_imgui.cpp` | `imgui_impl_opengl3` |
| In-game overlay | overlay pass inside `wgpu_end_frame` (`gfx_webgpu.c`) | `platformOverlayRender()` before `SDL_GL_SwapWindow` (`platform_sdl_min.c`) |
| Window adoption | device + surface + window | window + GL context |

The GL in-game path needed one new call site. mgb64 renders its GL overlay from
`gfx_end_frame` in the shared `gfx_pc.c` front-end; this project has its own
F3DDKR front-end (`gfx_pc_dkr.c`) and swaps buffers in `platform_sdl_present`
instead, so the overlay draw goes immediately before the swap there. It is a
no-op when no overlay hooks are registered, which is every CLI invocation.

The shell asks `mdkr_render_backend()` — the same resolver the engine uses — so
the launcher can never bring up a device the engine would refuse to adopt.

---

## Getting a ROM in

**Nothing on disk is ever searched.** An earlier version of this panel scanned
the working directory, `$HOME`, Downloads, Documents and Desktop and
auto-selected the first `.z64` it found. That was withdrawn after live macOS
validation, for three reasons:

1. It picked the **wrong ROM** when several dumps were present — "first match in
   scan order" is not "the one the player wants", and it happened before the
   player saw any UI.
2. Its in-app folder browser could not reach anything. It opened at the working
   directory (`"."`), and `parentOf(".")` returns empty, so no `..` row was ever
   emitted and there was no way to navigate out. Older `.app` builds also
   changed CWD to `Contents/Resources`, so the browser opened inside the signed
   bundle on an empty list with no exit.
3. Worst: `opendir()` on Downloads/Documents/Desktop trips macOS **TCC** and
   raises a system permission prompt before the player has asked for anything.
   For an unsigned fan-made source port that is alarming, and rightly so.

`rom_scan.{h,cpp}` is **deleted**, not disabled, and the panel calls no
directory-enumeration API at all. That is what makes "no permission prompt can
ever fire" a property of the code rather than a promise.

Four permission-free ways in, in the order a first-time player meets them:

| Path | Why it needs no permission |
| --- | --- |
| **Drag and drop** onto the window | `SDL_DROPFILE`. The drag is the user's own action; macOS grants access to what they dropped. |
| **Choose ROM File...** (native panel) | NSOpenPanel / GetOpenFileNameW. A file the user personally selects is TCC-exempt regardless of where it lives. |
| **Typed path** | The app opens exactly the one file named, and nothing else. |
| **Remembered ROM** | Stored in the app's own prefs file, which the app owns. |

Only a ROM that actually validates is remembered, so a refused revision can
never wedge the launcher into reproducing the same refusal every launch.

The ROM card leads with an unambiguous **Ready to Play** or **This ROM Cannot
Be Used** verdict, followed by the identified revision and byte order. Ready
means the normalized full 12 MiB image matches the supported SHA-256 and its
revision-specific asset LUT is structurally safe — header identity alone is
never enough. A wrong pick has to be visible *before* Play, not discovered
afterwards. A ready ROM gets an explicit **Change ROM…** button; the
acquisition controls stay hidden until then.

## Bundle resources and writable user data

The native entry point never changes CWD. When the executable is inside
`*.app/Contents/MacOS`, `platform/user_paths.c` registers the sibling
`Contents/Resources` directory as an immutable absolute root. The controller
mapping database is the only engine-opened payload in that resource tree;
icons, the privacy manifest, and signing metadata are consumed by macOS, not by
relative engine file I/O.

Mutable state is separate and always outside the signed bundle:

- `mdkr64.ini` is stored directly below
  `SDL_GetPrefPath("mdkr64", "mdkr64")`;
- EEPROM, automatic recovery points, and virtual Controller Paks are stored in
  its `save/` child;
- app-shell preferences and diagnostics already use that same SDL preference
  root.

`MDKR_VIDEO_CONFIG_PATH` (a complete filename) and `MDKR_SAVE_DIR` remain
explicit native overrides. They are used by automated/headless runs to isolate
state. A non-packaged command-line build retains the historical CWD-relative
defaults for the same reason. The browser remains `/save/mdkr64.ini` plus
`/save` on IDBFS.

On the first packaged launch only, when the new destination does not exist, the
path policy can copy legacy `mdkr64.ini` and known save files from the old
`Contents/Resources`/CWD locations. Save files are first copied into a sibling
staging directory and the complete directory is atomically renamed into place.
Migration never renames, deletes, or writes a legacy source; an existing new
destination always wins. If SDL cannot provide a writable preference root, the
package stops with a visible data-directory error instead of falling back into
the signed bundle.

Each save-migration stage carries destination-bound ownership metadata. If a
process is interrupted and a later process reuses that PID-derived stage name,
the launch validates the marker, removes only the known staged save set, and
restarts the copy from the untouched legacy source. Unrelated abandoned stage
names do not block an ordinary launch and remain untouched.
An older or foreign stage without valid metadata is preserved and produces a
message naming the exact folder to move aside; it is never guessed at or
silently deleted.

ROM selection and the final pre-Play recheck read and hash the complete image on
one generation-keyed worker. The launcher keeps rendering a byte progress bar;
a replacement or Cancel invalidates the active generation at the next 64 KiB
boundary, and only the newest path may publish a verdict. The engine still
performs its own boot-time validation as the final trust boundary.

---

## Settings are generated, not hand-written

`Settings_draw()` enumerates `mdkr_video_schema` and renders whatever it finds.
There is no second copy of the key list, so a new key cannot appear in the config
layer and be missing from the UI.

To make grouping a schema property rather than a UI opinion, `MdkrVideoSchema`
gained a `category` field (`Interface` / `Audio` / `Controller` /
`Presentation` / `Fidelity` / `Pacing`). A
new key therefore cannot be added without deciding where a player would look
for it.

The schema's category answers "which subsystem owns this key". The settings
page groups by what a player came to do, which is not always the same answer:
**Picture**, **Frame rate**, **Gameplay**, **Camera**, **Sound**,
**Controller**, **Advanced graphics**, **App window**. Camera and Menu
languages are `Presentation` keys that a player looks for under Camera and
Gameplay; Simulation cadence is a `Pacing` key that must not sit beside Frame
limit. A visible key that no group claims is rendered under **Other settings**
at the bottom, so the schema stays the source of truth and no key can be lost
by omission.

**Picture** leads and marks Restored as the recommended default. **Audio**
provides master, music, and effects volume without starting the game.
**Controller** exposes rumble enablement and
Light/Balanced/Strong profiles plus source-oriented remapping from SDL's
normalized buttons, D-pad, triggers, clicks, and right-stick directions to N64
actions or None. The left stick remains analog steering and a single atomic
action restores all controller defaults. **Original (recommended)** is the
frame-limit default. Match Display, numeric caps, and
native Uncapped add presentation opportunities without changing the gameplay
cadence; the adjacent **Motion smoothing** control decides what fills them:
Off holds the latest authored image, Interpolated draws unique
presentation-only in-between images. The browser
explains that its ceiling is the display's `requestAnimationFrame` cadence.
The native launcher keeps the Presentation pace quick choice directly visible
and the two keys it writes one disclosure below it, opened automatically when
they already spell a pair no quick choice names. The
browser uses a compact disclosure to keep its launch card manageable on mobile.
In both interfaces, **Gameplay cadence** is visually separated because that
choice changes gameplay and must never look like an ordinary FPS control.

Both settings change under the running game. The host pacer and the immutable
replay resources still latch at engine startup — that has not changed and could
not safely change — but they are now re-latched as one ordered step at a
boundary the engine declares, rather than written from the settings panel's own
call stack. Interpolated replay retains the complete authored graphics arena
plus external dependencies observed by the renderer, and fails closed to an
authored hold when adjacent ownership is unavailable. Enhanced remains a
gameplay-changing compatibility mode rather than a frame-rate control, and
remains restart-scoped.

Scope is presented honestly:

- **LIVE** keys apply immediately. The four that used to demand a relaunch —
  `Video.FrameLimit`, `Video.MotionSmoothing`, `Video.AllowTearing` — carry an
  `applies immediately` note so a returning player can see that the restriction
  is gone. Their value is written to the config at once and takes effect at the
  next host-frame boundary: after the previous present has retired and before
  the next tick's pacing decision, which is the only point at which no replay
  walk is in flight.
- **LEVEL** keys (`Camera.Obstruction`, `Camera.Comfort`) are badged
  `next track`, saved, and shown as
  `Set to Y — takes effect the next time a track loads (now: X)`. A
  camera policy change is a hard cut of the rendered eye and the resolver has no
  path that fades between two policies, so it is applied where the game already
  cuts the camera. No relaunch is involved. `Camera.Comfort` shares the domain and
  the boundary: one applier carries both keys, and one level-boundary reset
  clears the per-slot state either of them invalidates.
- **RESTART** keys (`Gameplay.SimulationCadence`, `Video.RemasterFX`,
  `Video.Mipmaps`, and others) are badged `restart`, saved, and shown as
  `Saved for next Play: Y (current: X)`. The Settings page keeps one primary
  action visible and renames it **Play with Changes** while anything is staged.
  The UI never implies a restart-scope change took effect. See the long comments
  in `platform/video_config.c` for what each key's receiver latches, and
  `video_config.h`'s deferred-apply note for how the LIVE/LEVEL keys re-latch
  theirs safely.
- Keys pinned by an environment variable or the command line are disabled and
  name the layer that owns them, because `mdkr_video_config_runtime_set()` would
  return `LOCKED` for them anyway.
- A Pure session never rewrites presentation or gameplay settings, so the panel
  says those controls are locked. Audio, window, controller, and rumble comfort
  controls remain available and persistent without changing the faithful
  presentation contract.

Every committed edit routes through `mdkr_video_config_runtime_set()`, which
validates, persists and then publishes only the LIVE half — and, for a key
whose receiver latches, publishes nothing at all, marking that receiver's
domain for its own boundary instead. Text fields retain
their local value through validation/storage failure and commit on Enter or
blur. Enum and checkbox controls likewise retain the attempted value when a
write fails. The visible Retry control resubmits that same staged value after
write access is restored, without restarting the process. Audio sliders preview
audibly with click-free ramps while dragged, restore the committed mix when the
player cancels or navigates away, and perform one durable transaction on
release. Other sliders also save only on release, so dragging cannot fsync the
configuration once per rendered frame. UI scale also waits for release before
changing theme metrics; applying it during a held drag would move the slider
under the pointer and create a whole-interface layout feedback loop.

ROM replacement follows the same last-known-good rule: a candidate is validated
and its preference is atomically saved before it replaces the active ROM. An
invalid or unsaved candidate is shown alongside the still-playable active ROM,
and Cancel always restores the prior view.

## Launcher journey contract

The launcher is organized around player states, not implementation panels:

| Player state | Required behavior |
| --- | --- |
| First launch | Say what Golden Balloon is, ask for a ROM, and make the persistent **Choose ROM** action open the native picker or lead to drag-and-drop/typed-path alternatives. |
| Returning with a valid ROM | Show the verified revision and keep **Play** available from every launcher section. |
| Replacing a valid ROM | Keep the proven ROM playable until the replacement validates and its path is saved. Cancel returns to the proven state. |
| Validation in progress | Keep rendering progress, permit cancellation, and prevent duplicate final-Play checks without freezing the UI. |
| Invalid ROM or persistence failure | Name the problem beside the affected ROM and offer a specific Retry, Change, or Forget action. Never replace the last known-good choice silently. |
| Editing settings | Separate live changes from restart-required changes, keep gameplay cadence distinct from presentation rate, and rename the persistent action **Play with Changes** while staged values exist. |
| Engine boot failure | Return to the launcher with the ROM and settings intact, an inline explanation, and **View Diagnostics** available. |
| Small window, large scale, gamepad, or touchscreen use | Preserve the same task order through the sidebar, top navigation, or dense dropdown, with visible focus, touch-sized actions, and scrolling instead of clipping. |

The native header deliberately mirrors the public website without importing its
large raster hero: the embedded font carries a gold/blue wordmark, the website's
checkered gantry becomes a quiet structural rule, solid gold is reserved for the
next primary action, and high-contrast cobalt marks the one active destination.
This keeps branding recognizable while leaving ROM status, errors, and controls
as the highest-contrast content.

## Native accessibility contract

The supported native accessibility target for this release is keyboard and
gamepad operation, visible focus, scalable high-contrast UI, and restrained
motion. It does **not** claim a native VoiceOver, UI Automation, or other screen-
reader semantic tree: Dear ImGui does not expose one by itself. The desktop app
is therefore not advertised as screen-reader compatible. Full assistive-
technology semantics would require a native accessibility bridge and separate
platform qualification.

The supported behavior is explicit:

- keyboard navigation and activation are enabled throughout the launcher;
- the in-game F1 overlay uses Escape and controller B symmetrically: close an
  ImGui popup first, dismiss confirmation, leave Settings, then close overlay;
- UI scale is persisted from 0.75x through 2.00x and scales fonts, controls,
  spacing, and navigation from an unscaled baseline (never cumulatively). A
  held slider edits only its displayed value; release applies the new layout
  once at the next frame boundary;
- framed controls provide at least a 44 px baseline row plus touch padding,
  while scrollbars and slider grabs use a 20 px baseline. On a 7-inch Windows
  handheld, 1.25x or larger is the recommended scale;
- a touchscreen drag that begins on non-interactive panel content scrolls it
  directly with the finger and stops on release. Drags that begin on a button,
  slider, combo, or the enlarged scrollbar remain owned by that control;
- moving between displays rebuilds fonts before the next ImGui frame while the
  renderer's dynamic-texture lifecycle safely retires the old atlas;
- the minimum supported logical window is 640x480. Below the wide breakpoint,
  the navigation rail becomes top tabs, controls clamp to available width, and
  actions stack instead of clipping;
- high-contrast cobalt selection, Amber Gold primary/focus state, light
  foreground text, and dark surfaces are checked by the capture-content gate;
  and
- the shell adds no decorative animation, auto-scrolling, or flashing content.

The release embeds one reviewed, redistributable Roboto Medium asset. Titles,
body text, and captions use distinct sizes and colors to establish hierarchy;
the app deliberately does not load an unreviewed system/remote Regular font,
which would make release rendering and licensing non-reproducible.

---

## Known limitations

**The overlay is a true pause boundary.** While it owns input, the game receives
no simulation updates and `is_game_paused()` reports paused. Renderer/event
pumping continues so the launcher remains responsive. Game-timed audio work
(delayed cues, music fades, and new simulation cues) receives the same zero
update rate; already-playing music, effects, and reverb tails continue through
the independently serviced host audio sink. The live
`check_overlay_pause.py` route enters an ordinary Time Trial through the app's
WebGPU handoff, opens F1 mid-race, and requires the complete deterministic state
hash plus kart position, race clock, checkpoint, and lap to remain exact for
200 host ticks before resuming.

**Return to Launcher performs an orderly process relaunch.** The overlay only
requests the transition. The engine then unwinds renderer/audio state, host
objects are released, the diagnostic tee restores stdout/stderr and joins its
reader, and only then does the platform replace the process. Windows uses the
wide-character runtime here (`_wexecv` on an extended-length image path),
including non-ASCII and deep executable paths. Two things keep the replacement
from landing headless under the deny-by-default rule: it passes an explicit
`--ui`, and on Windows every element of the argument vector — `argv[0]`
included — is quoted at the exec boundary, because the CRT joins that vector
into one command line with single spaces and no quoting of its own, so an
install path containing a space would otherwise arrive as several arguments.
A failed relaunch is shown visibly and returns non-zero instead of hanging on an
orphaned pipe. `check_restart_apply.py` drives Restart & Apply and Return to
Launcher through real process replacements and asserts each replacement's
invocation shape.

**No native file dialog on Linux.** macOS uses NSOpenPanel and Windows uses
GetOpenFileNameW (see "Getting a ROM in" above). There is no permission-free
native panel on Linux without a new hard build dependency — the
xdg-desktop-portal route needs libdbus at configure time — so `isAvailable()`
returns false there and the ROM panel draws no Browse button at all rather than
one that fails at runtime. Drag-and-drop and the typed path are the documented
paths on Linux, and both are always present on every platform.

## Gates

```
# Never opens a native launcher window:
env MDKR64_HIDDEN=1 MDKR_AUDIO=0 \
  SDL_MAC_BACKGROUND_APP=1 SDL_WINDOW_NO_ACTIVATION_WHEN_SHOWN=1 \
  ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -j1 \
    -LE 'gpu|app_process|browser'

# Native GPU/UI evidence:
cmake -S . -B build -DMDKR_ENABLE_GPU_TESTS=ON
env MDKR64_HIDDEN=1 MDKR_AUDIO=0 \
  SDL_MAC_BACKGROUND_APP=1 SDL_WINDOW_NO_ACTIVATION_WHEN_SHOWN=1 \
  ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure --no-tests=error -j1 -L gpu
```

Native screenshot/input tests set `MDKR64_HIDDEN=1`. Automation windows render
hidden or ordered behind the desktop by design (set
`MDKR_TEST_VISIBLE_HEADLESS=1` to watch one), and the release gate is the
complete suite wherever it runs. GL/WebGPU surfaces begin hidden,
cannot inherit fullscreen, are ordered behind existing macOS windows without
making the process active or the window key, and ignore OS fullscreen/raise
effects while still exercising settings persistence. Automated runs therefore
must not steal keyboard focus or switch Spaces. `app_background_activation_contract`
and `app_window` guard this behavior. A normal player launch remains foreground
and unchanged.

- `app_shell` — argv triage (including a census of every flag the real harness
  passes) and the ROM validator's failure paths.
- `app_schema` — every schema key has a category, label and help text, and
  round-trips by name. Fully headless.
- `app_shell_smoke` — drives the launcher for four frames and requires a
  captured frame on disk. `main_app.cpp` returns non-zero when a requested
  capture is missing, so this cannot pass without producing pixels.
- `app_settings_capture_content` and `app_settings_minimum_scale2_content` —
  decode the BMP, require dimensions, contrast, palette and content coverage,
  and prove blank/offscreen/invisible-foreground mutation controls fail.
- `app_top_tabs_smoke` / `app_top_tabs_scale075_smoke` and their dependent
  content checks — click a real intermediate-width destination, require the
  requested panel to become active, and prove the final capture contains both
  wordmark colors, the alternating brand rule, one cobalt selection with its
  Amber Gold indicator, and a solid-gold primary action at 1.00x and 0.75x.
- `app_touch_handheld_smoke` and its content check — render Settings at
  1280x720 and 1.25x, feed a real `SDL_TOUCH_MOUSEID` drag through the
  production SDL-to-ImGui adapter, require the scroll owner to move, and verify
  the effective target, scrollbar, grab, contrast, and visible-content bounds.
- `app_ui_input_persistence` — uses SDL mouse + keyboard and an SDL virtual
  gamepad to select 240 through the real combo; reloads it in a second process;
  then proves a visible storage failure leaves Original unchanged and a retry
  through the rendered Retry button succeeds after write access is restored in
  that same process.
- `app_gl_swap_interval_fallback` — injects swap-interval rejection and requires
  the diagnostic GL launcher to continue under its bounded software pacer.

Native GPU/window CTests are absent by default. Configure with
`-DMDKR_ENABLE_GPU_TESTS=ON` to register them.
`MDKR_SKIP_GPU_TESTS=1` remains a backwards-compatible emergency override for
older automation, but is no longer required to make a normal build safe.
Ordinary local CTest also excludes `app_process` and `browser` labels, runs
serially, and never launches the production application executable.

`MDKR_APP_SMOKE_DROP=<path>` extends the same headless smoke loop: it
synthesizes one `SDL_DROPFILE` inside `AppHost::pumpAndShouldQuit()` partway
through the run, after SDL's platform-event translation boundary. The event is
then consumed by the same handler and ownership path as a live OS drop. This
avoids pushing a platform-reserved event through SDL2 compatibility layers,
which cannot portably translate an application-built SDL2 drop payload to
SDL3's different event layout.
`tests/check_shell_dropfile.py` (`python3 tools/run_checks.py --only
shell_dropfile`) drives it both directions — a supported ROM accepted and
persisted, a non-ROM file refused without a crash — against an isolated
`MDKR_APP_PREFS_DIR` so it never touches the real shared prefs file.

Per `CONTRIBUTING.md`, every launch — including windowed ones — must set
`MDKR_AUDIO=0`. Synthesis still runs; only the output device is suppressed.
