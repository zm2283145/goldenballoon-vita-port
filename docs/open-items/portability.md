## OPEN: asset sub-entry indices are unbounded, and the one bounds check that exists fails silently — wave "subentry"

**Mechanism.** The master asset lookup table's *section* index is bounds-checked
(`asset_section_bounds()` in `game/src/asset_loading.c`). The index of an entry
*within* a section is not. This build is compiled for `us.v80` data and asks for
`us.v80` indices; `us.v77`'s `GAME_TEXT` has 259 entries where `us.v80` has 343
(`docs/ROM_REVISIONS.md` §5–6), so a `v80`-only index against a `v77` section is
an out-of-range read with no guard and no diagnostic — the silent shape, not a
crash.

**Measured evidence.** `tools/sweep_subentry_access.py`, built as the instrument
for this class before any fix, over `game/src` and `platform`:

```
276 site(s) in 22 file(s); 31 section table symbol(s), 18 with a derivable entry count
  by kind:    misc-accessor 75, section-offset 36, table-index 145, terminator-walk 20
  by verdict: CHECKED 129, UNCHECKED 65, UNKNOWN 82
```

`UNKNOWN` is reported as its own verdict rather than folded into `CHECKED`: it
means the classifier could not prove a bound, and under-reporting a hazard is
the failure mode this project punishes. The tool's own blind spots are recorded
in its docstring — no dominance analysis, no cross-function provenance, no
aliased tables — and the aliased-table case is the one that can cause an
*under*-count.

Three findings stand out:

- **`game/src/particles.c:739,757,758`** — `emitter_init_with_pos()` indexes both
  `gParticleBehavioursAssetTable` and `gParticlesAssetTable` with entirely
  unguarded parameters. This entry first said "both of its callers guard";
  **that was wrong, and measurement corrected it.** `emitter_change_settings()`
  clamps both IDs, but `emitter_init()` (`particles.c:724`) tests only
  `behaviourID` and passes `particleID` straight through unchecked. The check
  was on the wrong side of the call boundary *and* missing from one caller —
  which is the shape a per-function reading misses twice over.
- **A live latent crash sat behind that gap.** `particles_init()` allocates
  `count + 1` pointer slots and fills `for (i = 0; i < count; i++)`, so slot
  `[count]` is never written and `mempool_alloc_safe` does not zero. With
  `emitter_init()` not guarding `particleID`, `particleID == count`
  dereferenced uninitialised memory as a `ParticleDescriptor *`. It mirrors the
  N64 shape — there the slot holds an unconverted raw offset — so it is not a
  port regression, but it was reachable and silent. The guard now converts it
  into a named abort.
- **`game/src/objects.c:1474,4382`** — `gAssetsObjectHeadersTable[index]` and
  `gAssetsLvlObjTranslationTable[arg0]`, with no comparison anywhere in the
  function. The second is `obj_id_valid()` — a function whose only job is to
  validate an object ID, indexing with the unvalidated value before testing
  anything. `UNUSED`, so latent, but a booby trap for its first caller. Its
  guard uses `>` rather than `>=`: the trailing-zero trim leaves the last live
  index, not a one-past-the-end count.
- **The 75 `get_misc_asset()` / `get_misc_asset_size()` sites read as CHECKED,
  and that reading is generous.** The accessor *does* compare against
  `gAssetsMiscTableLength` — and on an out-of-range index returns the **section
  base**, silently. A bounds check whose failure mode is plausible wrong data
  rather than a diagnostic is barely better than no check: it converts an
  out-of-range read into a confidently wrong one. This is the specific behaviour
  `mdkr_asset_subentry()` is specified to replace.

**Measured reachability: not reachable today.** Unsupported revisions are
classified from their header CRC pair and refused by name before engine boot
(`platform/rom_id.c:265-302,332-342`), the refusal message cites this exact gap
as its reason, and no override exists for that verdict —
`MDKR_ROM_ALLOW_MODIFIED` only covers a damaged dump of an already-supported
revision. On a supported ROM every index the port asks for is in range by
construction.

**Fix: PARTIALLY APPLIED.** `platform/asset_subentry.c` provides
`mdkr_asset_subentry()`, which aborts with the section name, the requested index
and the actual count. `get_misc_asset()` and `get_misc_asset_size()` now go
through it, so the silent section-base fallback is gone from the arm this build
compiles; the `#else` N64 arm is byte-for-byte unchanged. The five named
unguarded sites are routed or guarded. Sweep moved 276 → 273 sites, CHECKED
129 → 133, UNCHECKED 65 → 59, and every row of that delta is accounted for.

The abort is proven reachable on the live path, not only in a unit test:
`MDKR_SUBENTRY_TEST_MISC_INDEX=100000` produces
`[FATAL] asset sub-entry index out of range: section=ASSET_MISC index=100000
count=71`, where 71 is us.v80's actual entry count read from the ROM at runtime.

**It is still open**, on three grounds:

1. **38 compile-time indices** (`ASSET_MISC_23`, `gWeatherAssetTable[3]`) are
   unbounded *by construction*. This is the v80-constant-on-a-v77-ROM shape
   itself, and no per-site guard fixes it — the answer is the exhaustive
   enumeration in S5 task 4, not a check.
2. **20 terminator-walks** are bounded by a byte pattern rather than a count.
3. **81 sites remain UNKNOWN** — no derivable count, or an index reaching
   through a pointer the classifier does not follow.

One cheap site is deliberately left: `game/src/game_ui.c:4774`,
`gAssetHudElementIds[spriteID]` with `spriteID` straight from level data. A
count exists (`gAssetHudElementIdsCount`) so it is a six-line fix in the same
shape, but its input domain spans every HUD sprite id in battle, challenge, boss
and adventure levels, and the regression routes do not reach all of them. An
abort added there without enumerating that domain risks firing on a supported
ROM, which is the one thing this work must not do.

**Verification.** `python3 tools/sweep_subentry_access.py` exits 1 while any
site is unchecked. The guard is invisible on us.v80: over a 3,600-row
`[SIMHASH]` v3 Time Trial capture, a binary relinked from pre-change objects and
the patched binary hash **bit-identically**
(`4424ce1559125e2fe947681e69025e35c3140bd992cbf1ecdf6b92a147a19ec2`).
`tests/check_subentry_bounds.py` is the negative control.

**Known staleness in the instrument:** `sweep_misc()`
(`tools/sweep_subentry_access.py`) hardcodes the note "out of range returns the
section base SILENTLY" for all 76 misc-accessor rows. That string is now
factually wrong for the arm the sweep scans. The verdict it reports is still
right, but it is asserted as a literal rather than derived, and it needs
updating.

## FIXED: tagged macOS artifact exposed a stale magic-code endian failure

The report had two coupled symptoms: every submitted code ended at `BADCODE`,
while the Code List rendered `8` and a blank row as enabled. A clean reproduction
on pre-fix commit `6f5515f` identified one cause for both: after decryption, the
mixed magic-code table still held a big-endian u16 count and offsets. A
little-endian host therefore read 29 cheats as 7424 and the enabled-code string
offsets 187/220 as 47872/56320, walking unrelated bytes for both lookup and text.

The original decrypt-then-normalize repair is already an ancestor of the
`v1.0.0` tag, and clean tag/current builds both accept `ARNOLD` and render
`BIG CHARACTERS — ON`. No hosted `v1.0.0` release or workflow artifact exists,
and the tag-era macOS script permitted packaging an arbitrary prebuilt binary;
the reported DMG therefore cannot be authenticated as a build of the tag and is
consistent with a stale pre-fix local executable.

The runtime boundary is now transactional and fail closed: after normalizing the
plaintext u16 index, it verifies the self-describing first offset and every
code/description offset plus its in-blob NUL terminator. Any failure restores
the original bytes and stops asset loading. The
`magic_codes` CTest pins the reported endian values, valid `ARNOLD` lookup and
description, damaged offsets, unterminated strings, and full rollback;
`check_asset_swap_invariants.py` independently pins decrypt-before-normalize
ordering with a reversed-order control. The `check_nav_fixtures.py` runtime arm
additionally enters `ARNOLD` through the real onscreen keyboard and requires
cheat id 4 to be accepted, then enters the near miss `ARNOLE` and requires it to
be rejected. The protected macOS pipeline now binds
the downloadable DMG to its commit, version, platform, and checksum.


## FIXED: macOS packaged app was reported as “damaged”

The report was distinct from the expected unidentified-developer warning: on an
M4 Mac mini running macOS 26.2, Finder rejected the app as damaged. The same
failure reproduced locally. The Release executable arrived from the linker with
a valid ad-hoc Apple-silicon signature; `build_app_bundle.sh --bundle-sdl2`
then used `install_name_tool` to rewrite its SDL2 load path and packaged the
mutated bundle without resealing it. `codesign --verify --deep --strict` failed
with an invalid resource/signature envelope and `spctl` rejected it.

The builder now removes inherited source xattrs, signs the bundled SDL2 image,
then seals the outer app ad hoc after all mutations. The intentionally unsigned
1.0.1+ path keeps that ad-hoc identity: the exact app in the read-only mounted
DMG must pass strict nested/resource/load-path verification and a LaunchServices
WebGPU present-and-capture smoke. Its `spctl` result is therefore only the
expected trust rejection for an ad-hoc identity, never a damaged-app rejection.

A separate, optional protected lane can replace that identity inside-out with
Developer ID + Hardened Runtime, require Accepted app and DMG notarizations,
valid staples, mounted-DMG re-verification, and Gatekeeper acceptance. It no
longer disables library validation or W^X speculatively, and the CI contract has
broken-direction controls for its credentials and signing/notarization steps.
That trusted artifact remains publication-disabled until an equivalent
post-sign LaunchServices/WebGPU runtime gate is automated; it is not a
prerequisite for the ad-hoc unsigned patch releases.


## FIXED: MIPS numeric conversion closeout

Three small errors leaned against one another in the port:

- `mtxf_to_mtx()` truncated 16.16 matrix words where the ROM uses `cvt.w.s`
  under the boot FCSR's round-to-nearest-even mode;
- `arctan2_f()` truncated its scaled inputs at the same conversion;
- `atan2_lookup()` added `0.5`, while the ROM computes an integer quotient
  `((numerator << 11) / denominator) & 0xFFE`.

`mdkr_mips_round_w_s()` now implements the MIPS tie-to-even and invalid
conversion contracts without inheriting the host process's mutable floating
point rounding mode. `mdkr_mips_atan_index()` models the assembly's byte offset
as the equivalent element index. `mtxf_to_mtxs()` deliberately remains
truncating because its assembly uses `trunc.w.s`.

The ROM-free runtime-contract test covers positive/negative half ties,
non-ties, NaN/infinity, and more than two million numerator/denominator pairs
against the literal assembly expression. `check_math_tables.py` still matches
all 1,025 arctangent/sine table entries and all 65,536 interpolated sine angles
parsed from the vendored assembly. A 7,500-frame live race completed with
finite steering/pace, live rendering, checkpoint 46, and lap 2.

## FIXED: core safety boundaries — wave "core-safety"

This wave closes the audit's remaining MEM-11, MEM-12, PORT-01, C-01, C-02,
and GAME-06 findings without changing valid campaign behavior.

- Texture loads now reserve capacity and exact command/palette storage before
  construction, validate source/frame spans, unwind palette state on failure,
  and commit cache state last. The ROM supplied two important valid boundary
  cases during the gate: final compressed alignment padding and a zero
  `textureSize` sentinel on a final/single frame.
- Custom reverb initialization owns both temporary allocations, validates the
  audio-table span, and selects a deterministic dry mixer on malformed data or
  allocation failure.
- Level-model offsets remain 32-bit serialized tokens until resolution;
  generated collision/index storage walks checked real host pointers. Object-map
  mutation uses checked `uintptr_t` ranges and `memmove`.
- Original US v80 ELF disassembly settled the audio-envelope question: IDO uses
  MIPS `cvt.w.d` and low-half extraction. Native helpers encode that exact
  behavior, including the indefinite word, and reconstruct signed 16.16 rates
  without shifting a negative integer.
- Pak extensions, course flags, trophy worlds, Taj fields, and snow shifts now
  distinguish logical bounds from intentional MIPS masked-shift semantics.
  Save-derived object models are checked against the particular object header at
  the final use site.

Validation on Apple arm64: 12/12 CTests in Debug and Release; 7,500-frame ASan
race; 7,500-frame Release race; optimized 240-frame
`array-bounds,pointer-overflow,shift-exponent` UBSan boot; 143.5-second PCM gate;
RAW16 same-binary fixed/legacy A/B; linked wasm/WebGPU build and ROM-absence
guard. Full `-fsanitize=undefined` reaches the separately open signed shift at
`rcp_dkr.c:430`; the limited sanitizer intentionally demonstrates that PORT-01
no longer needs a `tracks.c` suppression.

Follow-up capacity closeout widened all four ordinary `collision_get_y` caller
arrays to 16 elements; the wave builder retains its existing 30. The owning
UBSan/static/forced-overflow gate now measures a minimum 11 slots of live
per-call slack and still proves the legacy arm fails. `segmentsInside[8]`
remains deliberately unchanged: its caller explicitly treats eight or more
overlapping segments as "no waves," so enlarging it and accepting more would
change an original semantic decision rather than improve a capacity.

## FIXED: playable runtime boundaries — wave "runtimebounds"

**Audit IDs:** MEM-06, MEM-08, MEM-09, MEM-10, AUDIO-01, AUDIO-02
**Implementation:** `05cff1f`

Six source-proven P1 defects shared one missing rule: values crossing a lifetime,
branch join, normalization, or serialized-domain boundary were trusted without
establishing their complete contract.

- `level_free()` read its header after freeing it and compared a signed
  `skyDome` with unsigned `0xFF`, making weather teardown heap-dependent and
  leaking sky textures. It now snapshots child ownership, releases weather and
  signed-`-1` sky resources, frees the owner last, and clears both header aliases.
- Plane trick handling and ordinary weapon spawning now initialize their
  cross-branch state (`FALSE` and `NULL`) at declaration.
- The path helper returns success, writes the current object position when no
  checkpoint exists, and both callers use a checked finite X/Z normalizer.
  Zero/tiny/overflow/NaN directions become zero horizontal velocity.
- Audio allocates the five groups live callers address. Getter, setter,
  asset-key lookup, and sound-table lookup all enforce exclusive bounds.
- Vehicle audio validates all ten characters, the complete serialized 30-row
  span, and every vehicle before offset arithmetic. Flying-car/carpet maps
  explicitly to plane sound; loop-de-loop maps explicitly to car sound.

The ROM-free `runtime_contracts` CTest exhausts the declared base and special
vehicle domains, invalid and boundary IDs, exact/truncated/descending asset
spans, sound/group exclusive bounds, and finite/degenerate normalization.
`check_runtime_safety.py` then proves the production call sites retain those
contracts and deletes each required source fragment as a positive control.
Debug, Release, ASan, UBSan, and wasm builds pass. Focused navigation,
Adventure return, 143.5-second PCM, RAW16 A/B, all 47 legal vehicle
combinations, and the array/pointer/shift sanitizer sweep remain green.

## Hand-asm transcription audit — wave "hasmaudit"

A follow-up to the sixth bug shape the "gridmask" wave added: **C bodies that
transcribe hand-written assembly, which only this port compiles.** Upstream's
matching build takes `GLOBAL_ASM(...)` and links the real `.s`, so a transcription
error in that C is invisible to every amount of matching progress upstream will
ever make. `compute_grid_overlap_mask()` was one. This wave asked whether there
were others.

**The ground truth is in the tree**, which is what made this tractable rather than
speculative: `game/src/hasm/ido/math_util.s` (122 KB, 44 `LEAF`s),
`game/src/hasm/collision.s` (3 `glabel`s), `obj_animate.s`, `obj_shade_fast.s`,
`gzip_asm.s`.

### What was audited, and how

Every C function was paired with its assembly counterpart and diffed
instruction by instruction, ranked by the shape of the known defect —
**conditionals and loop bounds first** (`slt`/`slti`/`beq`/`bne` vs the C's
`<`/`>=`/`==`, and for each one *which operand*, and whether it is loop-rolling or
loop-invariant), then array indexing and pointer advance, then signed-vs-unsigned
and `sra`-vs-`srl`, then hot paths over cold.

| file | C bodies | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `game/src/hasm/math_util.c` | 30 `NON_MATCHING` + 4 plain (of 44 `LEAF`s) | **3 divergences**, 2 fixed |
| `game/src/hasm/collision.c` | 3 | **1 divergence**, fixed |
| `game/src/hasm_native/obj_animate.c` | 2 (+2 helpers) | clean |
| `game/src/hasm_native/obj_shade_fast.c` | 2 | clean |
| `game/src/hasm_native/inflate_native.c` | 5 (+4 helpers) | clean **as a transcription**; see the retracted malformed-input verdict below |
| `game/src/objects.c` `func_80017A18` | 1 | **not compiled at all** — see below |
| `platform/math_util_native.c` (the `.s` **data** section + the trig with no C body) | 9 symbols | **3 divergences**, 0 fixed |

Coverage worth stating honestly: `obj_animate`/`obj_shade_fast` were checked at
41/41 conditional branches, 18/18 compares, 11/11 loop trip counts and 93
sign-sensitive loads; `gzip_asm.s` at all 781 lines, 111 branch instructions and
137 of 158 rodata table entries, plus a 301-stream / 529-block zlib differential.
Four `math_util.c` bodies are guarded by `#ifdef NON_EQUIVALENT`, which this build
does **not** define — `mtxf_transform_dir`, `fix32_sqrt`, `bad_int_sqrt`,
`calc_dyn_lighting_for_level_segment` are therefore **not compiled** and were not
audited as live code. (`mtxf_transform_dir`'s dead body contained a real error —
`*mf[1][0]` indexes the *next matrix in memory* instead of `(*mf)[1][0]`. It has
since been **corrected in place** so the trap cannot fire if the body is ever
enabled; the live implementation is still `platform/math_util_native.c`, which
was correct all along.)

### FIXED 1: `vec3f_rotate_py()` paired each angle with itself instead of pitch with yaw

**Mechanism.** `game/src/hasm/math_util.c`. The upstream `NON_MATCHING` body had
the two angles **transposed** in the x and y results:

```c
vec->x = z * cosY * sinX;      /* WRONG */
vec->y = -z * sinY;            /* WRONG */
vec->z = z * cosX * cosY;      /* right */
```

`LEAF(vec3f_rotate_py)` (`game/src/hasm/ido/math_util.s`, ROM `0x800706D0`) loads
the **pitch** first and the **yaw** second:

```
lh    a0, 0x2(a2)     # pitch
jal   sins_f
mul.s ft1, ft2, fv0   # ft1 = z * sin(pitch)
lh    a0, 0x2(a2)     # pitch
jal   coss_f
neg.s ft1             # y   = -z * sin(pitch)
mul.s ft2, fv0        # z1  =  z * cos(pitch)
lh    a0, 0x0(a2)     # yaw
jal   sins_f
mul.s ft0, ft2, fv0   # x   = z1 * sin(yaw)
lh    a0, 0x0(a2)     # yaw
jal   coss_f
mul.s ft2, fv0        # z   = z1 * cos(yaw)
```

The **offsets** settle it and the `.s` comments do not: `Vec3s`
(`game/include/structs.h:51`) is a union whose rotation view puts `y_rotation` at
`0x0` and `x_rotation` at `0x2`, so the pair loaded first (`0x2`) is the pitch. The
`.s` labels `0x0` "roll", which is what the transposition was copied from.

**A second proof that needs no assembly.** The function is documented as
`vec3f_rotate()` specialised to `(0, 0, z)` with zero roll, and `vec3f_rotate()` —
which does match *its* assembly — yields exactly `(z·cosX·sinY, −z·sinX,
z·cosX·cosY)` for that input. Before the fix the C contradicted its own sibling;
after it, they agree. That invariant is what the regression check asserts, so the
check does not rest on anyone's reading of the disassembly.

**Measured.** Self-test at boot, `pitch = 0`, `yaw = 0x4000` (90°), `z = 100`:

| | x | y | z |
|---|---|---|---|
| ROM formula / fixed | **100.0000** | −0.0000 | −0.0000 |
| transposed (pre-fix) | −0.0000 | **−100.0000** | −0.0000 |

i.e. **a horizontal direction came out vertical.** Case B (`pitch = 0x2000`,
`yaw = 0x1000`): fixed `(27.0598, −70.7107, 65.3281)`, matching
`100·cos45°·sin22.5°` etc. analytically; transposed `(65.3281, −38.2683, 65.3281)`.

**Reachability.** 250 live calls in 1500 boot/attract frames; 201–6761 per race
depending on track. The two arms' output hashes differ, so the transposition was
material to vectors the game actually asked for.

**Why it was silent.** Every call site feeds the result straight into a position or
a velocity, so a wrong direction still moves something plausibly — nothing crashes
and nothing logs. Call sites: particle emission (`particles.c:1163/1165/1214/2393`),
the lens flare (`weather.c:631`), spotlight direction (`lights.c:413`), object
sprite placement (`objects.c:493`).

**Behaviour-neutral for the racer simulation** — 0 of 359 `[PACE]` rows changed on
Ancient Lake, and a full 3-lap Time Trial records the **same course time** in
both arms — because no call site feeds physics. That is *why* the check counts calls
and hashes outputs instead of diffing a `[PACE]` stream: a stream diff could never
see this fix, in either direction.

(Unrelated, noted while measuring: `check_race_finish_time`'s course time has moved
twice — 4709 in the "finishtime" wave below, 4713 when this wave measured it, and
**4777** as the check now records it, after the `ParticleBehaviour` stride fix moved
the trajectory. The check asserts a 3000–9000 band and cross-checks traced against
recorded rather than pinning a value, so this is informational — and it is *not*
from this wave, since both arms agree.)

Not wrapped in `#ifdef NATIVE_PORT`: it is a transcription correction, not a host
adaptation, exactly as with the grid-mask fix.

### FIXED 2: an untextured terrain batch was skipped instead of collided with

**Mechanism.** `generate_collision_candidates()`, `game/src/hasm/collision.c` —
the same function as the grid-mask defect. For `textureIndex == 255` the upstream
body did `continue`, dropping the batch, so untextured level geometry is not solid.
The ROM zeroes the surface and falls into the triangle loop
(`game/src/hasm/collision.s`):

```
800313D0  addiu $at, $zero, 0xFF
800313D4  or    $t2, $zero, $zero   # surface = SURFACE_DEFAULT
800313D8  beql  $v1, $at, .L8003141C
800313DC   lh   $t0, 0x4($t5)       # (branch-likely delay slot)
800313E0  sll   $v1, $v1, 3         # else &textures[textureIndex]
800313E4  add   $v1, $v1, $a0
800313E8  lb    $t2, 0x7($v1)       #      surface = surfaceType
```

`.L8003141C` (`collision.s:234`) is the **triangle-loop setup**, not the batch-skip
labels `.L80031488`/`.L8003148C` that this loop's four genuine `continue`s branch
to. The decisive evidence needs no reading of the branch target: `or $t2, $zero,
$zero` at `800313D4` would be **dead code** if `0xFF` meant "skip", because every
falling-through path overwrites `$t2` at `800313E8`. It exists only to give the
untextured case `SURFACE_DEFAULT`.

**Reachability: NOT REACHED, and that is stated as a limitation, not a result.**
`untexturedBatches=0` across all 20 main tracks and all 10 boss tracks
(2600 frames each), and again on tracks 5/38/32/15 with a 9400-frame budget
(6759 racer rows each). So the correction is **behaviour-neutral on shipped data**
— which is also the strongest available statement that it broke nothing. It is
landed as a latent-correctness fix with a counter left in place as the tripwire.

**Because it is unreached, comparing the two arms alone would prove nothing**, so
`MDKR_COLLTEX_FORCE=1` treats every batch as untextured. That makes the harm
observable, on Ancient Lake:

| arm | untextured batches | peak candidates | min racer y |
|---|---|---|---|
| default | 0 | 26 | 29 |
| `MDKR_COLLTEX=legacy` | 0 | 26 | 29 (bit-identical, 759 rows) |
| `MDKR_COLLTEX_FORCE=1` | 11334 | 26 | 29 |
| forced **+** legacy | 8938 | **1** | **−568** |

The forced+legacy arm's candidate list collapses to a single entry — the segment
pointer, with no facets behind it — and the racer drops straight through the
world. That is the shape the divergence would take on any level that did contain
an untextured collidable batch.

### FIXED 3: `area_triangle_2d()` folded four factors left-to-right where the assembly pairs them

**Mechanism.** `game/src/hasm/math_util.c`. The `NON_MATCHING` body wrote Heron's
product as `m * (m - d0) * (m - d1) * (m - d2)`, which C evaluates strictly
left-to-right as `(((m*(m-d0))*(m-d1))*(m-d2))`. `LEAF(area_triangle_2d)`
(`game/src/hasm/ido/math_util.s:2618-2620`) builds a balanced tree instead:

```
mul.s fv0, ft0, ft5     # fv0 = (s - d0) * s
mul.s ft1, ft2          # ft1 = (s - d1) * (s - d2)
mul.s fv0, ft1          # fv0 = fv0 * ft1
```

Single-precision multiplication is not associative, so the two groupings differ
by up to ~1 ULP before the `sqrt`. Everything else in the body — the half
perimeter `0.5f * ((d0 + d1) + d2)`, the three `sqrtf` distances, and the
negative clamp — already matched instruction for instruction; only the grouping
did not. Re-associated to `(m * (m - d0)) * ((m - d1) * (m - d2))`, the same
correction and the same comment style as `mtxf_mul()` above it.

**Consequence.** Sub-ULP on an area that the sole caller
(`game/src/tracks.c`, occlusion accumulation) reduces to a visibility fraction,
so nothing observable changed — this is a free bit-exactness restoration, and it
closes a divergence the table above previously did not record.

### Found, measured, and deliberately NOT fixed *(items 1–3 were fixed in wave "closedloop")*

1. **The RNG seed is wrong.** `platform/math_util_native.c` has shipped
   `gCurrentRNGSeed = 0x00051234`, `gPrevRNGSeed = 0` since the first platform
   commit, invented to make the link succeed. The `.data` section of
   `game/src/hasm/ido/math_util.s` has **`0x5141564D`** (`'QAVM'`) for *both*.
   These are the live starting seeds: `set_rng_seed()` has exactly one caller in
   the whole game (`game/src/waves.c:364`, `set_rng_seed('WAVF')`, bracketed by
   `save_rng_seed()`/`load_rng_seed()`), so nothing re-seeds at boot and all 98
   `rand_range()` call sites — including `racer.c` (13) and `particles.c` (25) —
   descend from it. The port has been on a different random sequence from frame 0.
   **Silent because the run is still perfectly deterministic, just
   deterministically wrong**, which is precisely why `check_determinism.py` could
   never see it.
   *Deferred, not unproven*: measured **80 of 359 `[PACE]` racer rows changed**
   from row 279. Turning it on shifts every AI racing line, and the
   route-calibrated fixtures do not survive that — `check_race_drive`'s open-loop
   route strands the kart (cp 14 vs the 15 required, lap 0 vs 1), and
   `check_collision_gridmask`'s **positive control stops reproducing** (only 1
   racer loses the ground where it needs 2; the `MDKR_BOSS_SLOW` win arm stops
   reaching `racer_boss_finish()`). Re-cutting those fixtures is a wave of its own
   and must not happen as a side effect of an audit — flipping the default without
   it would trade a silent fidelity bug for a blind test suite.
   `MDKR_RNGSEED=rom` selects the ROM's values, and
   `tests/check_math_tables.py` asserts that arm is exactly right so the fix
   cannot rot while it waits.

2. **`gArcTanTable` is truncated where the ROM rounds.** Same file, same
   deferral. Verified entry by entry against `EXPORT(gArcTanTable)`:
   **truncating mismatches 491 of the 1025 live entries** (all one unit low),
   `+ 0.5f` mismatches **0 of 1025** — rounding reproduces the ROM's table
   exactly. One unit is 1/65536 of a turn, so nothing looks wrong; it just puts
   every `atan2s()`/`arctan2_f()` result up to an LSB off the ROM's, at 72 call
   sites including the AI's steering and the camera. Measured **110 of 359
   `[PACE]` rows changed** from row 233 — same fixture problem as the seed.
   `MDKR_ARCTAN=round` selects it.

3. **`sins_s16`/`coss_s16`/`sins_f`/`coss_f` approximate the ROM instead of
   reproducing it.** The ROM reads `gSineTable` and linearly interpolates on a
   4-bit fraction (`XLEAF(sins_s16)`: `lhu`/`lhu`/`subu`/`mul`/`srl 3`/`sll 1`);
   the port calls `sinf`/`cosf` and scales by 65536. Compared over **all 65536
   angles**: exact on only **21368 (32.6 %)**, mean absolute difference 2.1 units,
   **max 7** units of 65536. Tiny in absolute terms, but systematic and on the
   hottest math in the game (every rotation matrix, racer, camera and audio pan).
   **An exact implementation is available with no ROM data committed**:
   `round(sin(i·π/2/1024)·0x8000)` reproduces the ROM's `gSineTable` **exactly,
   0 of 1025 entries differing**, so the table can be generated at load time
   exactly as `gArcTanTable` is, and the ROM's lerp applied on top. Not done here
   because it lands in the same fixture-recalibration bucket as (1) and (2), and
   because getting hot trig wrong would be far worse than the divergence.
   `tests/check_math_tables.py` pins the `gSineTable` generator so that route
   stays open.

4. **`func_80017A18` is a `return 0` stub — object-model collision never reports a
   hit.** Not a transcription defect; an *unpaired* function, which the audit
   treats as a finding in its own right. `objects.c:5718` guards the body with
   `#ifdef NON_EQUIVALENT`, which this build does not define, so `objects.c.o`
   carries `U _func_80017A18` and the link resolves to the `WEAK` no-op in
   `platform/hasm_stubs_temp.c` (`nm`-verified in both objects). **Measured 8
   calls on boss track 38** over a 9400-frame race (0 on tracks 5/32/15), so the
   gap is live but narrow on the routes measured.
   **Not fixable within this audit, and the reasons matter:** there is *no
   ground-truth assembly for it anywhere in the tree* (`objects.c` cites
   `asm/nonmatchings/objects/func_80017A18.s`, which this repo does not vendor),
   so it cannot be differentially audited at all; upstream itself labels the body
   `NON_EQUIVALENT` (decomp.me/scratch/xNAlf), i.e. known not to reproduce the
   ROM; and enabling it is not a small change — under `NATIVE_PORT` it **does not
   compile** (`objects.c:5768` subscripts `collisionFacets`, a `dkrptr32` token),
   and `objects.c:5748` assigns `collisionPlanes` without `DKR_PTR`, which would
   silently yield a wild pointer once the build error above was fixed. A counter
   is now wired into the stub so the size of the gap can be measured rather than
   guessed. **This was not previously recorded anywhere** — the nearby
   `collision_objectmodel` entry below is about a stack array in the *caller*.

   > **FIXED 2026-07-26 by [wave "objcoll"](collision.md#fixed-object-model-collision-never-reported-a-hit-so-locked-doors-were-intangible--wave-objcoll), and two claims above are
   > retracted.** "No ground-truth assembly anywhere" and "upstream labels the body
   > `NON_EQUIVALENT`" were both **true when written and false when acted on** —
   > upstream matched it in `9da89ecb`. The `dkrptr32` claim was correct, and
   > `DKR_PTR` was the entire fix: two lines. The "8 calls on boss track 38 …
   > narrow on the routes measured" figure also badly understated the gap, because
   > every route measured was a *race track*: a single Timber's Island run makes
   > **948** calls. The lesson for this audit is that a finding recorded against a
   > moving upstream needs a re-check before it is used to justify not acting —
   > the reachability numbers need to come from the routes where the affected
   > objects actually live, not from whichever routes already existed.

5. **`mtxf_to_mtx` and `arctan2_f` truncate where the ROM rounds to nearest.**
   The assembly distinguishes the two float→int conversions deliberately:
   `mtxf_to_mtxs` uses `trunc.w.s` (`math_util.s:363-366`) while `mtxf_to_mtx`
   uses **`cvt.w.s`** (`:639-642`), which follows the FCSR mode — round-to-nearest
   on a booted N64. The C uses `FTOFIX32`, a C cast, i.e. truncation. Same at
   `arctan2_f` (`:2310-2311` `cvt.w.s` vs `(s32)(y * 255.0f)`). ≤1 LSB of 16.16,
   silent, and systematically toward zero. Not changed: the correction is
   `nearbyintf`, and it is not worth perturbing every RSP matrix in the game for
   a fidelity item this small until (1)–(3) are being landed together.

6. **`atan2_lookup` rounds the table index where the ROM truncates**
   (`math_util.c:743` `(s32)(y / x * 1024 + 0.5f)` vs `dsll 11`/`ddivu`/`andi
   0xFFE`). ≤1 index step ≈ 0.044°. Note this leans the *opposite* way from (2),
   so the two partially cancel today; fix them together or not at all.

### Verified faithful — do NOT "fix" these

- **`vec3s_reflect`'s `//!@bug`** (`math_util.c:260`, `vec[1].z` subtracting
  `vec->x`) **is real in the ROM.** `math_util.s:789-797` carries it explicitly,
  gated: the `#else` arm is `sub t5, t5, t0` with `t0` still holding `incident.x`,
  and only the `AVOID_UB` arm subtracts `t2`. The C is an exact transcription of
  the ROM path. Consistency note, not a bug: this build defines `AVOID_UB=1`, so
  the assembly *would* take the fixed branch if it were ever assembled, while the
  compiled C keeps the ROM behaviour — the C body has no `AVOID_UB` gate.
- **`generate_collision_candidates`'s `counter == 10` segment cap** — already
  recorded under wave "gridmask"; still faithful (measured peak 3 on every track
  swept). Its *unbounded segment-pointer store* is no longer in this bucket: a
  `NATIVE_PORT` `j >= mdkr_coll_cap(MAX_COLLISION_CANDIDATES)` pre-check now
  guards both inserts ahead of their stores, keeping the ROM's `==` test below
  them rather than editing it. See
  [wave "boundsweep"](collision.md#swept-three-shapes-no-instrument-could-see--wave-boundsweep)
  class 2.
- **`rand_range`'s 64-bit mixing looks wrong and is not.** `temp = (temp << 32) |
  (temp >> 1)` bears no resemblance to the assembly's 33-bit rotate
  (`dsll32`/`dsrl`/`dsll`/`dsrl32`/`or`), but every bit that differs is above bit
  31 and is discarded by the `sw`. Verified by modelling both semantics exactly:
  **0 divergences over 20008 seeds and two 200000-step chains.**
- **do-while → `for` rewrites** throughout `obj_animate`, `obj_shade_fast`,
  `inflate_native` and `collision.c`: the ROM runs one iteration on a zero count
  (and in two places spins ~2³² times or hangs). The C is the safer side of the
  divergence every time. Do not "correct" toward the ROM.
- **`inflate_native.c` is not a transcription** but an independent puff-style
  DEFLATE decoder, so the audit's instruction-by-instruction method does not apply
  to it. **This entry's original verdict — "every semantic divergence is confined
  to malformed input, and in each case the C is the safer arm" — is RETRACTED.**
  The game-core memory-safety wave found the opposite: the decoder had no output
  window, no input bound, no back-reference validation, and discarded every
  block-decoder error, so a malformed stream looped forever. It now writes only
  inside the `[gzip_inflate_output_start, gzip_inflate_output_end)` window derived
  from the rzip header's declared length, reads only below
  `gzip_inflate_input_end`, validates every match distance against what it has
  already produced, rejects reserved BTYPE 3 and malformed Huffman descriptions,
  and reports a sticky negative status that ends the stream in `gzip_inflate()`.
  A valid stream is byte-identical. The remediation wave then gave all six callers
  an explicit compressed extent through `gzip_inflate_sized()`, because the
  pool-block fallback bounded against the *destination*, not the compressed span.
  Side effect worth knowing: `gzip_huft_build` and the 0x2800-byte `gHuftTable`
  are compiled out under `NATIVE_PORT` rather than merely uncalled — the
  reservation was sized for 4-byte huft entries and would have been half-sized on
  an LP64 host.

### Smaller things noticed and left alone

- **`mtxf_scale_y` silently implements the `AVOID_UB` branch, not the ROM's.**
  `math_util.s:1218-1220` has a gated bug — the `#else` arm reads
  `lwc1 ft4, 0x14(a3)`, i.e. garbage from the wrong register ("Should be a0"),
  where the `AVOID_UB` arm reads `a0`. The C body is unconditionally the fixed
  form. Behaviour agrees today because `CMakeLists.txt` defines `AVOID_UB=1`, so
  this is *not* a live divergence — but unlike `vec3s_reflect`, which keeps its
  ROM bug and says so in a `//!@bug` comment, `mtxf_scale_y`'s C says nothing
  about departing from ROM behaviour. Left as is; worth a comment if anyone
  touches it.
- **`coss_2` has no implementation in this port at all.** `math_util.s` defines
  `LEAF(coss_2)` (official name `mathCos`), `math_util.h` does not declare it and
  nothing calls it, so the link succeeds without it. Harmless today; it is simply
  missing, not stubbed, so a future caller gets a link error rather than a wrong
  answer — which is the right failure mode.
- **A malformed doc comment** at `math_util.c:374-379`: line 378 is ` /` where
  `*/` was meant, so the block comment above `mtxf_scale_y` swallows the
  `/* Official name: mathSquashY */` line. Compiles fine, no behavioural effect.
  Not touched, to keep the diff against upstream minimal.

### Regression checks

Three new, all headless + muted, all validated in **both** directions.

| check | asserts | positive control (fix reverted → FAIL) |
|---|---|---|
| `tests/check_math_rotpy.py` | the `vec3f_rotate` invariant, the ROM formula, the A/B wiring, and 250 live calls with differing output hashes | all four assertion families fire |
| `tests/check_collision_untextured.py` | 0 untextured batches + bit-identical arms on shipped data; forced arms 26 cand/y 29 vs **1 cand/y −568** | forced+fixed collapses to 1 candidate and y −568, indistinguishable from legacy |
| `tests/check_math_tables.py` | `MDKR_ARCTAN=round` reproduces `gArcTanTable` **exactly** (FNV `0xe0d93ef8`, 0/1025) and `MDKR_RNGSEED=rom` boots `0x5141564D`; the default arm is still the known divergence | ROM arm perturbed → caught; default flipped → tripwire fires with instructions |

`check_math_tables.py` parses the ground truth out of the vendored `.s` at run
time, so **no ROM-derived bytes are added to the repo.**

## SWEPT: decomp arrays split into two C objects and indexed across the boundary (wave "splitsweep")

The follow-up the "wavetable" wave asked for. That wave fixed **one** instance —
`waves.c`'s `D_8012A5E8[2]` + `D_8012A600[24]` treated as one 26-entry table — and
recorded that *the class was not swept*. This is the sweep: two instruments, the
whole existing fixture set, a triaged finding list, three fixes, and a check that
catches the next one at build time.

### The one number that matters

```
tools/compare_data_layout.py --stats
1001 data pairs have the SAME neighbour on both targets; 432 of them (43%) sit at a
DIFFERENT distance.
```

That is the class in one line: **adjacency on LP64 Mach-O predicts nothing about
wasm32.** wasm-ld gives every data symbol of 16 bytes or more a 16-byte preferred
alignment, so it leaves holes Mach-O does not; Mach-O 8-byte-aligns small symbols,
so it leaves holes wasm-ld does not; and neither reproduces the decomp's source
order (`gTrackWaves` and `D_8011D128` come out *reversed* on wasm32). Any decomp
idiom that indexes past the end of one global and expects to land on the next is a
coin flip, per pair, per link. Do not reason about it — measure it, then make it a
language guarantee.

### Instruments (both, on the full fixture set)

**1. UBSan `-fsanitize=array-bounds,pointer-overflow`, 99 runs.** This is the
instrument that had already seen the wave defect and been ignored. Built with
`-DMDKR_EXTRA_C_FLAGS=...` (a new hook, because `-Wno-everything` in CMakeLists.txt
lands *after* `CMAKE_C_FLAGS` and would otherwise swallow the flag), reports
collected via `UBSAN_OPTIONS=log_path` so the existing checks' stdout parsing is
untouched. Coverage: the 9 `nav_*` menu fixtures, a 6000-frame attract soak, boss
tracks 38 and 39–45 (`MDKR_BOSS_SLOW=1`), `check_race_drive`,
`check_race_2p_split`, `check_collision_gridmask`, `check_texture_lineswap`,
`check_adventure_hub`, `check_adventure_race_loop`, `check_race_finish_time`,
`check_track_sweep` (20 tracks) and `check_vehicle_sweep` (47 combos). Every run
exited 0; the reports are pure UB, no crashes.

**2. Layout comparison, LP64 Mach-O vs wasm32,** now committed as
`tools/compare_data_layout.py`. Native addresses come from `nm -n build/mdkr64`.
wasm32 addresses come from a `wasm-ld --Map`, which emcc does not emit by default —
the tool re-links `build-web`'s existing objects using the link command read
straight out of `build-web/CMakeFiles/mdkr64_web.dir/link.txt`, and then **verifies
the relinked wasm is byte-identical to the shipped one** and refuses to print
anything if it is not. (The web build is bit-reproducible; this is one more thing
that depends on keeping it that way.)

A third instrument was tried and is worth recording as a **dead end**: a static
`-Warray-bounds -Warray-bounds-pointer-arithmetic` compile of the whole tree
produces **zero** warnings. Every instance of this class indexes with a *variable*,
so the static warning cannot see any of it. ASan is also blind to the global cases
— both arrays in the wave defect were `__DATA,__common`, which ASan does not
redzone — and blind to `get_inside_segment_count_xz`-style overruns, which write
through a bare pointer rather than an indexed array.

### The deduplicated finding list — 9 sites, all of them

Ranked as instructed: reached on wasm32 > reachable in principle > latent.

| # | site | report | runs | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `menu.c` `gTrackSelectIDs[4][6]` row 4 | `index 4 out of bounds for 's16[4][6]'` | 88/99 | **REACHED, load-bearing, behaviour was wrong on BOTH targets — FIXED** |
| 2 | `camera.c` `gScreenViewports[4]` idx 4 (×2 sites) | `index 4 out of bounds for 'ScreenViewport[4]'` | 99/99 | **REACHED, benign by arithmetic accident — FIXED** |
| 3 | `menu.c` `gCharacterVolumes[0][19]` (×4 sites) | `index 19 out of bounds for 'u8[2]'` | 93/99 | in-bounds of the whole object — allow-listed |
| 4 | `racer.c` `D_800DCDB0[0][0..31]` | `index N out of bounds for 's8[2]'` | 55/99 | in-bounds of the whole object — allow-listed |
| 5 | `tracks.c:2994` / `:3001` | `pointer-overflow` / null-pointer offset | 99/99 | a *different*, already-documented class — allow-listed |

Sites 3 and 4 are the **flattened 2-D index**: `u8 gCharacterVolumes[10][2]` walked
as one 20-byte run through `[0][n*2+1]` (max flat index 19, the last element), and
`s8 D_800DCDB0[16][2]` (32 bytes) indexed `[0][miscAnimCounter & 0x1F]`, i.e. 0..31
— exactly the whole object. Both are ISO-C UB and both are memory-safe,
layout-independent and identical to what the N64 does. Not the class; not touched.

Site 5 is `j = (s32) align16(...)` in `track_load_level()`: the decomp's `s32`
scratch holding an arena address. Correct on the N64 and on wasm32 (32-bit
pointers); on LP64 the round-trip trips `pointer-overflow`. That is the
LP64-pointer-truncation class, tracked in its own section.

**What the sweep did NOT report is evidence too.** Every one of the following is a
*directly indexed* constant-bound array, so `-fsanitize=array-bounds` instruments it
and 99 clean runs mean the index stayed in range. Peak values were then measured
directly with a throwaway probe over 9 tracks (every wave track + boss 38), the
attract demo, 2P split-screen, the Adventure hub loop and the menu graph:

| carried-in candidate | bound | measured peak | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| `objects.c` `collision_objectmodel` `spB4[20]`/`sp8C[20]` | 20 | **1** | **FIXED** since the collision hasm audit — both arrays now hold the full 20-object candidate capacity (was `[10]` against a count capped at 20; see `collision.md`'s wave "boundsweep" item 3); 19 slots spare |
| `tracks.c` `D_8011D128[20]` / `gTrackWaves[20]` write at `[20]` | 20 | **8** | latent, 12 slots spare |
| `game.c` `gLevelPropertyStack[20]` pushed unbounded | 20 | **4** (one 4-word frame) | **BOUNDED** since the game-core memory-safety wave: `level_properties_push()` drops a push past `ARRAY_COUNT` under `NATIVE_PORT`. Peak unchanged |
| `camera.c` `gCameraRelPosStackZ[5]` write at index 5 | 5 | **1** | latent — contained anyway, see below |
| `camera.c` `gModelMatrixF[5]` dereferenced while permanently NULL | — | pos peak **1**, needs 4 | latent and **faithful**: `D_80120DA0` only has storage for 5 matrices, so `gModelMatrixF[5]` is NULL on the N64 too and the real game cannot reach it either. Left alone. |
| `objects.c:5288` `func_80016748` `f32[4][3]`-for-`MtxF` | — | n/a | already safe: `AVOID_UB=1` selects the `MtxF` branch |
| `hasm/collision.c` `generate_collision_candidates` | 500 | 416 (previous wave) | owned by the hasm audit; both inserts now carry a `j >= cap` pre-check ahead of the store (wave "boundsweep" class 2, with the facet-side check corrected in the 1.0.5 bounds wave) |

### Fix 1 (the real one): `gTrackSelectIDs[4][6]` is a 5×6 grid, and `gFFLUnlocked` IS `[4][0]`

`trackmenu_init()` fills the track-select grid with
`for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) for (j = 0; j < 6; j++) gTrackSelectIDs[i][j] = ...` — five
rows, and the body even special-cases the fifth (`if (sp74 == 4 && i != 4)`). The
array is declared `[4][6]`. Row 4 is therefore written **12 bytes past the end**.

On the N64 that is exactly where `gFFLUnlocked` and the two following "UNUSED" s32
live, and **the game depends on it: `gFFLUnlocked` has no other writer anywhere.**
The decomp's own address-derived symbol names prove the adjacency —
`gTrackSelectIDs` is `0x801268E8`, so `&gTrackSelectIDs[4][0] == 0x80126918`, and
the next two symbols are literally named `D_8012691C` and `D_80126920`. The
"UNUSED" markers on those two are wrong; they are `gTrackSelectIDs[4][2..5]`.

Our linkers put `gFFLUnlocked` nowhere near it:

| target | `&gTrackSelectIDs` | `&gFFLUnlocked` | delta (must be 48) |
|---|---|---|---|
| native | `0x1009b3070` | `0x1009b2844` | **−2092** |
| wasm32 | `0x0002d950` | `0x0002d99c` | **+76** |

So `gFFLUnlocked` was never written, and row 4's 12 bytes landed on
`gTrackSelectRenderDetails[0]` natively / `gTrackTTSoundMask` + `D_80126848` on
wasm32. Measured with a probe on the `nav_to_track_select` route, fresh EEPROM:

```
before:  delta=-2092  gFFLUnlocked=0   maxTrackY=4
after:   delta=48     gFFLUnlocked=-1  maxTrackY=3      <- the ROM's behaviour
```

**This was a live, visible gameplay defect on both native and the browser build.**
`spaceWorldUnlocked = gFFLUnlocked == -1 ? 3 : 4` came out **4 on a fresh save**, so
`menu.c:9198`'s `gTrackSelectCursorY < spaceWorldUnlocked` let the cursor scroll
down onto the **Future Fun Land row before it is unlocked**, `maxTrackY` came out 4
so that row was *drawn*, and `gTrackIdForPreview = gTrackSelectIDs[4][x]` then read
an unrelated object as a level id — natively `gTrackSelectRenderDetails[0]`, which
the renderer rewrites every frame, so pressing A there loads an arbitrary level.

Fix: back both names onto one 5×6 object (`gTrackSelectIDsTable`), `NATIVE_PORT`,
two `_Static_assert`s locking the offset of `fflUnlocked` and the total size.
Verified as one 60-byte object on both targets (`tools/compare_data_layout.py`).
Both symbols are menu.c-local. Every existing check still passes, including all
nine `nav_*` fixtures and `check_race_finish_time` — i.e. nothing was navigating
through the phantom fifth row.

### Fix 2: `gScreenViewports[4]` — the most-reported UB in the codebase

`viewport_reset()` sets `gActiveCameraID = 4` by hand and then reads
`gScreenViewports[gActiveCameraID].flags`; `viewport_rsp_set()` does the same. The
array is `[4]`. **99 of 99 runs report it.** What it reads is `gViewportStack[2]` on
all three targets (N64 `0x800DD068` + 256, native `0x1008ec048` + 256, wasm32
`0x00019840` + 256 — all land on `gViewportStack + 0x20`), and
`VIEWPORT_EXTRA_BG == 0x0001` while `viewport_rsp_set()` only ever stores multiples
of 4 into `vscale`, so bit 0 is always 0 and the branch is always the right one.
Benign by arithmetic accident, not by design, and one relink from flipping the
full-screen camera onto the extra-background path.

Fix: a fifth `{ DEFAULT_VIEWPORT }` element under `NATIVE_PORT`. Provably
behaviour-identical — every write path (`camEnableUserView` / `camDisableUserView` /
`viewport_menu_set`, all called with index 0, plus `copy_viewports_to_stack()`,
which loops `i < 4`) touches only 0..3, so element 4 keeps its initialiser forever
and its `flags` is 0, exactly what the OOB read returned.

### Fix 3 (containment, provably a no-op): `gCameraRelPosStackZ`

`mtx_cam_push()` writes X, Y and Z at the same index and only *then* warns
`if (gCameraMatrixPos > CAMERA_MODEL_STACK_SIZE)`, so index 5 is legal by the code's
own contract. X and Y are `[+1]`; Z is not. A Z write at index 5 lands on
`gCameraTransform` natively, on **`gTransitionsDisabled`** on wasm32 (an unrelated
subsystem's flag), and on `perspNorm` on the N64. Measured peak
`gCameraMatrixPos` = **1**, and UBSan reported nothing here in 99 runs, so this is
unreachable today and sizing Z like X and Y is a no-op. It is in because the
alternative, if some future track does push a sixth matrix, is a silent 4-byte
write into another subsystem — the exact shape of the second browser crash.

### The detector: `tests/check_array_bounds_sweep.py`

The generalisation of `check_wave_visible_table.py`, and deliberately **not** a
table of symbol pairs. Reasons: (a) after the fixes there is no load-bearing
adjacency left that is not already a `_Static_assert`, so a pair table would assert
things the compiler already guarantees; (b) a pair table only knows about pairs
somebody already thought of, and the whole problem is the ones nobody has. What
generalises is the *cause*: an index leaving its array.

So the check builds the UBSan binary, drives 8 representative routes (~1.5 min),
and fails on any out-of-bounds index that is not in a committed allow-list, each
entry carrying the reason it is not a finding. Entries are keyed on
**(file, type, source snippet)** rather than line number, so moving code does not
re-baseline the list but *changing* the offending line does — that is exactly when a
human should look. (Demonstrated in passing: the allow-list kept matching when the
reported lines moved 7378 → 7383 and 2994 → 3001.)

Fails closed, four ways: the binary must actually import
`__ubsan_handle_out_of_bounds` (proving the sanitizer flag survived CMake's flag
ordering); every route must exit 0; the report set must be non-empty; and
`REQUIRED_SENTINELS` — allow-listed idioms on paths every route crosses — must all
still be reported, so "clean" can never be confused with "not measuring".

**Validated in both directions, on real builds:**

| tree | result |
|---|---|
| fixes applied | 4 sites, all allow-listed → **PASS** |
| `gTrackSelectIDsTable` union reverted | + `menu.c:8502 index 4 out of bounds for 's16[4][6]'` → **FAIL** |
| `gScreenViewports[5]` reverted | + `camera.c:1097 index 4 out of bounds for 'ScreenViewport[4]'` (and menu.c's, also reverted at that point) → **FAIL** |

### Left alone on purpose

- Everything in the "did NOT report" table above. Each is faithful to the ROM,
  measured unreachable with real slack, and patching on speculation adds risk
  without removing a defect. `check_array_bounds_sweep.py` now fires the day any of
  them becomes reachable, which is a better guarantee than a guessed fix.
- The two flattened-2-D idioms (`gCharacterVolumes`, `D_800DCDB0`). Both stay inside
  one object on every target. "Fixing" them would change decomp text for no
  behavioural gain.
- `tracks.c`'s `s32`-as-pointer sites — a different class with its own section.
- `hasm/collision.c` and `hasm/math_util.c` — owned by the hand-assembly audit.
- `waves_block_hq()`'s unguarded `gWaveModel[indexNum]` and `free_track()` not
  zeroing `gWaveBlockCount`: still 0 occurrences, still latent, still recorded in
  the "wavetable" section.
- `get_inside_segment_count_xz()` writes one `s32` per matching segment through a
  bare pointer with **no bound**, and `get_level_segment_waves()` checks
  `segmentCount >= 8` only *after* the call, so 8+ overlapping segments overflow
  `segmentsInside[8]` on the stack. **Neither instrument can see this one** —
  array-bounds needs an indexed array, and ASan does not cover it either since the
  overrun is through the callee's pointer. `inSegs[28]` at the other call site has
  much more slack. Recorded as the known blind spot of this sweep; the next
  instrument for it is a bound parameter, not a sanitizer.

### Files touched

`game/src/menu.c`, `game/src/camera.c` (fixes), `CMakeLists.txt` (the
`MDKR_EXTRA_C_FLAGS` sweep hook), `tests/check_array_bounds_sweep.py` and
`tools/compare_data_layout.py` (new).

## LP64 pointer-truncation crash class — SYSTEMATIC SWEEP (robust: wave)
The whole `(u32)/(s32)`-cast-of-a-pointer class was enumerated and classified,
not just the sites a single boot path happened to hit. Method: the build already
keeps `-Wint-to-pointer-cast -Wpointer-to-int-cast` VISIBLE (they survive
`-Wno-everything`), so every truncation is a compiler warning. Clean build = 211
unique cast sites across 36 files; each was read and put in one of three buckets:

  1. **BUG — truncate-then-dereference** (the crash class). `(Type*)((u32)hostptr +
     off)` or `(T*)(s32) realptr` whose result is dereferenced in HOST memory
     without going through the arena reconstructor. On LP64 `(u32)` truncates and
     `(s32)` sign-extends the 64-bit arena pointer -> wild -> segfault (ASLR-dep).
  2. **TOKEN — truncate-to-token-then-reconstruct** (CORRECT, left alone). `(u32)
     hostptr` fed to `asset_load`/`dmacopy`/`osPiStartDma` (dest reconstructed via
     `dkr_lo32_to_ptr` inside `osPiStartDma`), `OS_K0_TO_PHYSICAL`/`gDkrDmaDisplayList`/
     `rsp_segment` (DL word resolved by `dkr_resolve`), or a `gTextureCache/
     gSpriteCache/gModelCache/minimapSpriteIndex/tex->cmd` slot read back via
     `DKR_PTR`. `(uintptr_t)` here would BREAK the DL/DMA path.
  3. **VALUE — truncate-for-value/compare** (fine). pointer-difference sizes,
     low-nibble alignment extraction, `(s32)a==(s32)b` identity within one arena,
     printf, packed offset+flag words.

FIXED (all case-1, with `(uintptr_t)` — pointer-width, so the warning also
disappears, proving the swept sites are no longer truncating):
  - objects.c racerfx_alloc (gBoostTris/gBoostVerts) — boost geometry, every race.
  - objects.c finish-challenge `((Camera*)camera)->mode` (widened the `s32 camera`
    local to `uintptr_t`) — race finish.
  - objects.c objFreeAssets / ObjSetupObject cleanup — `tex_free`/`free_3d_model`
    of `(s32)`-truncated D_8011AE50/54, obj->modelInstances[i], obj->textures[i]
    (real pointers) on object teardown / spawn-failure.
  - objects.c + racer.c `sndp_stop((SoundHandle)(s32) racer->unkXX)` (10 in racer.c,
    5 in objects.c) + object_functions.c door/ttDoor->soundMask — SoundHandle/
    AudioPoint* are real runtime pointers; sndp_stop DEREFERENCES the handle.
    (Latent while audio was still silence-stubbed, but a live crash the moment
    a non-NULL handle exists — fixed now so M5 audio can't reintroduce it.)
  - lights.c lights_init (gShadeBuffer/gLightDirs) — per-frame lighting buffers.
  - memory.c pool init `_ALIGN16(slots)` (the macro truncates to u32; only the
    POINTER use at pool setup was a bug — the size uses are fine).
  - video.h FBALIGN — framebuffer/depthbuffer alignment (also fixes a latent
    mempool_free-of-truncated-pointer on video-mode change; the segment token
    `(s32)fb` is bit-identical before/after so rendering is unaffected).
  - textures_sprites.c material_set_blinking_lights (Spaceport Alpha) advance.
  - menu.c bootscreen_init_cpak gBootPakData[] (controller-pak / file-select).
  - menu.c cheatmenu_checksum `&__ROM_END`: native __ROM_END is a pointer VARIABLE
    so `&__ROM_END` is garbage, not the ROM extent -> unbounded ROM-buffer OOB
    reads. Bounded to the real us.v80 __ROM_END (0x00B8CFD0). Only reachable via
    the ROM-checksum cheat, not normal MAGIC-CODES navigation.

DEAD-CODE case-1 left as-is (no caller — cannot crash; documented so they are not
mistaken for live bugs): objects.c func_8000E5EC/E79C/E558 (object-map compaction),
tracks.c trackMakeAbsolute, memory.c align8/align4 (UNUSED), main.c mainproc bzero
(native boot bypasses mainproc). object_models.c D_8011D644 is write-only.

ASan spot-check (build-asan, game_select / file_select / magic_codes / race_drive)
surfaced TWO pre-existing stack-buffer bugs in code this sweep did NOT touch —
they are a DIFFERENT class (fixed-size stack arrays, pointer-width-independent),
do NOT segfault in the normal build (0/20 both before and after — the overrun lands
in adjacent unused stack), and are OUT OF SCOPE for the pointer-truncation sweep.
Tracked here so they are not lost:
  - [x] menu.c fileselect_render: `char trimmedFilename[4]` overflows by 1 (a
    filename_trim writes output[len]='\0' with len up to 4). Benign off-by-one in
    the decomp, independent of LP64. **FIXED:** the native buffer is 32 bytes with
    a compile-time save-name bound; filename-entry repeats under ASan.
  - [x] camera.c render_sprite_billboard (via weather.c lensflare_render) reads 2
    bytes past a stack sprite buffer — the SAME game-side billboard/sprite
    vertex-data issue already tracked ("BILLBOARD SPRITES stretch into thin bars").
    **FIXED:** callers now pass `ObjectTransform` and animation frame explicitly
    instead of casting smaller HUD/particle records to `Object`; the native-layout
    gate retains the old cast as its required ASan-failing control.
No ASan finding was an int-to-pointer / heap-wild-pointer error, so the
pointer-truncation fixes themselves are ASan-clean for their class.

-Werror decision: NOT flipped on. The remaining ~200 warnings are all case-2 token
truncations (`(u32)` is their PURPOSE) and case-3 value math; a full
`-Werror=int/pointer-cast` would require wrapping every one in a `DKR_TOKEN()`
macro — a ~150-site edit across the working DL/asset path, exactly the regression
risk this wave must avoid. The warnings stay VISIBLE (so a NEW case-1 truncation
shows up), and the live-path case-1 count is zero. Tracked as future work.

## From asset-swap workstream (M2-swap, commit b1600b2)
- [x] Multi-frame texture walking is asset-bounded and rejects a zero/invalid
  stride; only single-frame write-size-false assets may encode zero, where the
  decoded payload boundary owns the extent. The sprite/texture ROM census and
  moving-mip gate exercise the production layout.
- [x] Level-model BSP-tree node array — SWAPPED in M4 (see "M4 render state" above).
- [x] `LevelModelSegment.unk8` is serialized and normalized as a 32-bit value,
  but current production source never reads it. Its exact original meaning
  therefore cannot affect the shipped port; future use must classify it before
  assigning semantics.
- [x] `ObjHeaderParticleEntry` is explicitly two `s32` words, size 8; the asset
  normalizer swaps both words per entry and the object-layout contract locks the
  owning header offsets.
- [x] `ASSET_AUDIO` byteswap — CLOSED (M5). Rather than an in-place header swap
  (which the overlay-and-patch alBnkfNew/alSeqFileNew can't do safely on LP64,
  since ALBankFile/ALBank/ALInstrument/ALSound/ALWaveTable embed 4-byte on-disk
  pointer slots that are 8 bytes here), the bank/seqfile parsers were rewritten
  (then the decompiled `bnkf.c` under `NATIVE_PORT`, now the bank parser in
  `platform/audio_bank.c`) to read the raw big-endian image
  through explicit byte offsets and build fresh, host-laid-out, arena-resident
  structs (the mgb64 audio_compat.c model). Raw ADPCM/VADPCM sample data stays in
  ROM, byte-order-defined (fetched by the audiomgr DMA callback). Since wave
  "raw16", the three uncompressed PCM loads convert big-endian samples to host
  representation through `aLoadRaw16Buffer`; the ADPCM byte-stream load remains
  untouched. Also swapped at load: the
  compressed-MIDI ALCMidiHdr (trackOffset[16]+division, in music_sequence_init)
  SoundData.soundBite/.range u16 (audio_init), and the mixed u16/s16 fields in
  each VehicleSoundAsset record (racer_sound_init).
- [x] `ASSET_EMPTY_14` remains byte-order-defined intentionally: TLUT entries are
  loaded as raw bytes and the HLE reconstructs each RGBA16/IA16 entry MSB-first.
  CI palette bounds and transactional loads are enforced before commit.

## [RESOLVED in M3] LP64 asset-struct layout — the blocker below is fixed
architecture decision 8 implemented: every ROM-overlaid struct's embedded pointer fields
are now 4-byte `dkrptr32` token slots under NATIVE_PORT (game/include/dkr_native_ptr.h),
preserving on-disk layout; derefs go through DKR_PTR(), patch sites store DKR_TOK()
tokens, and _Static_assert offset/size locks guard each struct. Converted:
LevelHeader, TextureHeader, TextureInfo, LevelModel, LevelModelSegment,
ObjectModel, ObjectHeader. The post-inflate/whole-record asset swaps (the
"Integration pending" item below) are now wired, and the ASSET_MISC LevelHeader_70
sub-asset swap (asset_swap_misc_lightdata) is called at the func_8007F1E8 sites.
`--headless-frames 300` exits 0. The original blocker text is kept below for
history.

## M3 BLOCKER — LP64 asset-struct layout (found in M2, the "first real frame" gate)
DKR overlays its C structs directly on ROM asset bytes. Several of those structs
embed real C pointers, which are 8 bytes on the 64-bit host but 4 bytes on N64.
That inflates the struct and shifts EVERY field after the first pointer off the
on-disk N64 offset that asset_swap normalizes, so any read past that point is
garbage. asset_swap can't fix this — it's a struct-layout problem, not endianness.
Confirmed offenders (there are more):
- `LevelHeader` (structs.h): `s8 *AILevelTable` @0x20 (used via &field), the
  `LevelHeader_70 *unk70[1]` union @0x70, and `LevelHeader_70 *unk74[7]` @0x74.
  First wall the natural boot hits: level_load() reads `unk74[i]` at the wrong
  host offset → get_misc_asset(garbage) → func_8007F1E8 OOB (textures_sprites.c
  ~1694).
- `TextureHeader` (structs.h): `Gfx *cmd` @0x0C shifts numOfTextures/isCompressed/
  textureSize/uncompressedSize — breaks load_texture()'s compressed path (garbage
  uncompressedSize → out-of-arena DMA). Blocks ALL texture/font/sprite loading,
  so the menu can't render either.
- Same class expected in `LevelModel`/`LevelModelSegment`, `ObjectHeader`,
  `ObjectModel` (offset-table + pointer fields).
Fix options for M3: lay these structs out to match disk on LP64 (make the
embedded pointers 4-byte on-disk slots + hold the runtime pointer as a token
reconstructed via dkr_lo32_to_ptr, à la TextureHeader.cmd), OR read the on-disk
records through explicit byte offsets instead of struct overlay.

## Asset-swap gaps found while iterating M2
- ASSET_MISC sub-asset `LevelHeader_70` (Spaceport Alpha pulsating lights),
  reached via get_misc_asset(LevelHeader.unk74[i]). ASSET_MISC is punted
  (heterogeneous), so this record is still BE. Layout: 0x00 s32 unk0 (entry
  count), 0x04/0x08/0x0C s32 unk4/unk8/unkC, 0x10/0x14 ColourRGBA (u8x4, no
  swap), then unk0 × { 0x00 s32 unk0 (swap); u8 r,g,b,a } at 0x18. The type is
  only knowable at the func_8007F1E8 call site. (Currently unreachable — gated
  behind the LevelHeader LP64 wall above.)
