# Open items — Saves and progression

> One subsystem of the split [open-items index](README.md), which states how these files are kept.

**Currently open** (per [`README.md`](README.md#still-open)'s open/closed
table): 1 item — save states (below). Every other entry is closed or resolved;
kept as the append-only historical record.

| Item | Where |
|---|---|
| Save states are blocked on payload scope, not on pointers. A raw arena snapshot restores correctly at a different host base address — the 32-bit-token argument holds — but ~800 KB of authoritative state lives in host globals outside the arena, and no enumeration expressible in this codebase covers it | [§ OPEN: save-state capture is blocked by payload scope — wave "savestate"](#open-save-state-capture-is-blocked-by-payload-scope-not-by-pointer-tokens--wave-savestate) |


## OPEN: save-state capture is blocked by payload scope, not by pointer tokens — wave "savestate"

**Status.** S2 Task 7 (save-state capture and restore) stopped at its own step-1
feasibility gate. `platform/save_state.c`'s container — header, versioning,
truncation and checksum refusal — is shipped and unit-tested
(`ctest -R save_state_container`). Nothing captures or restores, and `F5`/`F7`
are unbound.

**What the plan assumed.** That this engine stores intra-structure pointers as
32-bit arena tokens (`mdkr_arena_token_from_host`, `dkr_lo32_to_ptr` in
`platform/stubs_dkr.c`), so a raw arena snapshot plus a short list of globals —
enumerated from `platform/segment_consts.c` and the `[SIMHASH]` v3 field list in
`platform/sim_hash.c` — would be restorable. Half of that is true. The half that
is not is the half the payload is made of.

**Measured. The pointer-token argument holds.** All arms below run the same
route (`tests/input_scripts/nav_to_time_trial_race.txt`, `MDKR_AUTOPILOT=1`,
`MDKR_LOAD_TRACK=5`, `MDKR_STATE_HASH=3`, `MDKR_AUDIO=0`, `--headless-frames
4200`): capture at tick 2800, run to 3400, restore, run to 4000, and compare the
two 600-row `[SIMHASH]` v3 segments. Because macOS re-bases the 16 MiB arena on
every launch, the six runs behind this table landed at six different arena bases
(`0x442000000`, `0x5d5000000`, `0xb28000000`, `0xb5a000000`, `0xbb6000000`,
`0xce8000000`) and produced the *same* pre-restore segment hash every time.
Restoring a snapshot into a differently-based arena is not the problem.

| Payload | Segment A (2801-3400) | Segment B (3401-4000) |
|---|---|---|
| arena only | `cfcbaab7…b98fc2fc` | *(none — SIGSEGV)* |
| arena + game-owned globals | `cfcbaab7…b98fc2fc` | `3a2889d2…620b7fcc` (diverges at the first tick) |
| arena + game-owned globals + 4 platform globals | `cfcbaab7…b98fc2fc` | `cfcbaab7…b98fc2fc` |

(Full digests: `cfcbaab79ff737adfbb66403b3efb02f8a3ad1253cb40e042c8404e1b98fc2fc`,
`3a2889d260cc2a45d112e76b5094efce9efd65d6ba2529be6e61a300620b7fcc`, over the
concatenated `h=` fields of the 600 rows in each segment.)

**Mechanism, arm 1.** Rewinding the arena alone does not diverge — it faults, at
the restore boundary itself, before the next `[SIMHASH]` row is emitted:

```
EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=1, address=0x10)
  frame #0: sndp_handle_event(...) at game/src/audiosfx.c:328
      sound = soundState->sound;
```

`soundState` reached that dereference from an event queue rooted in host globals
(`gSoundPlayer`, `gSoundStateLists`, `game/src/audiosfx.c`), which still describe
the post-restore world while the arena they point into has been rewound 600 ticks.
This is the general shape, not an audio quirk: on this port the memory *pool*
lives in the arena (`mempool_init((MemoryPoolSlot *)arena, …)`,
`game/src/memory.c:203`) but every *root* into it — `gObjPtrList`, `gObjectCount`,
`gSettingsPtr`, `gMemoryPools`, the sound-state lists — is an ordinary host global
in the game's own `.bss`/`.data`. Rewinding one side of that pair without the
other is what crashes.

**Mechanism, arm 2 — the four platform globals.** With the game's globals added,
the run survives but diverges on the *first* tick after the restore. Two causes,
both outside the arena and both genuinely authoritative:

- `gCurrentRNGSeed` / `gPrevRNGSeed` (`platform/math_util_native.c:258-259`) — the
  gameplay RNG, which is literally the second value `sim_hash_compute()` folds in.
- the synthetic N64 COUNTER: `osGetCount`'s guard and the simulated field
  accumulator behind `platform_sim_field_count()` (`platform/stubs_dkr.c`). The
  game's `audioPrevCount` is a game global and *is* rewound, so a COUNTER that is
  not rewound makes `music_animation_fraction()` integrate a 600-tick delta in one
  step, which reaches hashed model `animFrame` state.

Neither is a pointer fix-up; both are machine state a save state ought to carry.
Adding them is what turns arm 2 into arm 3.

**Why this still stops.** The blocker is the *scope* of "the globals outside the
arena", not any of the three arms above. Measured over one 600-tick window on one
route, by diffing the process image's `__DATA` `__data`/`__bss`/`__common`
sections across the window and resolving every changed byte-range to a symbol:

```
__data    30 bytes changed over   33,088    __bss  8,945 over 3,206,864
__common 1,890 bytes over 1,938,184        223 distinct symbols
  of which game-owned: 142 symbols, 2,965 bytes (29 of them file-scope static)
```

The two inventories the plan names plausibly yield about twenty globals. The
sufficient payload — measured, not estimated — is the arena plus **every
externally-linked writable global defined by a `game/src` translation unit**:
1,686 symbols, 808,964 bytes. That arm reproduces the stream byte-for-byte
(row 3 above). Two narrower shapes were tested or considered and rejected:

- **File-scope statics are not needed.** Arm 3 leaves ~9 KB un-restored — game and
  platform file-scope statics, plus renderer caches — and is still byte-identical,
  so `sBoostTable`, `sSceneDrawOrder`, `sFaithfulCullPlanes` and the rest are
  per-tick scratch. That is the one piece of good news: the payload does not have
  to reach inside a translation unit.
- **A hand-written list fitted to this measurement is worse than nothing.** The
  142 game symbols that moved are the symbols that moved *on this route, in this
  window*. A payload built from them would pass a three-track gate and silently
  produce a corrupt state on the first route nobody measured — a green gate over
  an incomplete payload, which is the failure mode this ledger exists to prevent.

**Why it was not built anyway.** Only two payload definitions are both complete
and implementable, and each is a new invariant this project has not paid for:

1. **1,686 enumerated symbols.** Most are decomp `D_8011xxxx` externs with no
   declared type in any header. The table is neither writable by hand nor
   reviewable, and it falls behind silently the first time a game global is added.
2. **A contiguous region.** Game-owned globals *do* happen to occupy four
   contiguous runs at the front of each `__DATA` section on this link
   (`__data` 24,848 B, `__bss` 195,664 B, `__common` 689,360 B + 95,008 B, 1,004,880
   B total), and snapshotting those four runs also reproduces the stream exactly.
   But that layout is a link-order artifact of one toolchain. Depending on it would
   assert, silently and on every platform this port targets, that no platform TU's
   data ever lands between two game TUs' data. That is a far larger unpaid
   invariant than the pointer fix-ups the plan already ruled out — and getting it
   wrong restores host handles and freed pointers rather than merely producing a
   wrong hash.

**What would unblock it.** A first-class boundary rather than a list: each
translation unit that owns authoritative state outside the arena publishes its own
span (`#ifdef NATIVE_PORT`, one accessor per TU, `_Static_assert`-checked), and
capture walks the registry. 42 of the 64 `game/src` translation units define
externally-linked writable data and would need one accessor each; the completeness
claim would then be per-TU and local rather than global and fitted. That is a real
piece of work with a real payoff — it is also the registry a deterministic replay
or a network rollback would need — but it is not something to smuggle in under a
save-state task.

**What is already in the tree.** The container and its unit test
(`platform/save_state.[ch]`, `tests/test_save_state_container.c`, CTest
`save_state_container`) are complete and passing, and `platform/save_state.c` is
now linked into the engine. `tests/check_save_state_roundtrip.py` does not exist:
there is nothing yet for it to gate. `platform/save_container.c` and the progress
EEPROM path were never touched, and `check_save_failsafe.py` passes unchanged.


## FIXED: save progression and persistence isolation

The live game represents course progress as prerequisite bits:
`VISITED`, `CLEARED`, then `SILVER`. EEPROM stores the four ordered states
`0..3`. The old writer counted independent bits, so impossible states changed
meaning on reload: `CLEARED` alone became `VISITED`, while
`VISITED|SILVER` became `VISITED|CLEARED`.

`mdkr_save_course_flags_to_status()` now persists only the longest valid
prerequisite prefix; `mdkr_save_course_status_to_flags()` owns the reverse
mapping. The ROM-free codec test exhausts all four serialized states and all
eight live low-bit combinations. Legal states are exact, while impossible
states can only lose unsupported bits and can never gain a progression bit.
The engine uses those same helpers at its EEPROM boundary.

The compiler-layout declaration now names the actual config bits: the
default-high bit is 24 and subtitles is 25. Static assertions lock the slot and
config block sizes, while the byte codec remains the serialization authority.

Finally, save-write custody is explicit. Adventure gameplay schedules the live
`Settings` source only through the tracks-mode guard. Forced cartridge copies
source the selected `gSavefileData[]` object; Controller Pak imports decode into
the dedicated fourth scratch object before scheduling it. The SI boundary
consumes that typed source exactly once. Browsing the aggregate Tracks records
can still populate live menu state, but that object has no forced persistence
route.

Evidence: 21/21 CTest; native build; the complete save fail-safe matrix
(torn/garbage/autosave/poisoned Adventure/Taj); linked wasm and ROM-absence
guard; and the ROM/GPU/engine-independent browser save-custody gate, including
all six transaction failures, hostile input, native interchange, recovery,
merge, edit, wipe/import/reload, accessibility, and zero-upload checks.

### NOT REPRODUCED (the literal first reading): a save cannot send BOOT into a race
*Scope: this rules out the boot path — logo/title/menus — only. The corrected
symptom is a Taj challenge replayed after normal menu navigation, which is
Defect 4 and does reproduce.*

Stated plainly because the retraction matters more than the fix. **No content of
`save/eeprom.bin` can make the boot enter a race.** Two independent lines:

1. **By construction.** The Adventure resume path is
   `menu_file_select_loop()` → return `gNumberOfActivePlayers` → `mode_menu()`'s
   `menuLoopResult > 0` branch → `load_next_ingame_level(n, -1, …)` →
   `gPlayableMapId = get_track_id_to_load()`. `get_track_id_to_load()`
   (`menu.c:13654`) returns `settings->courseId` for a non-new game — but
   `menu_file_select_loop()` calls **`init_racer_headers()`** three lines before it
   returns, and that sets `gSettingsPtr->courseId = 0`
   (`thread3_main.c:1153`). So the resume target is *always* levelId 0,
   ASSET_LEVEL_CENTRALAREAHUB. `courseId` is also **not in the save file at all** —
   `SaveFile` (`save_layout.h`) has no level field, and neither
   `populate_settings_from_save_data()` nor `func_800732E8()` touches it.
2. **By measurement.** 98 headless boots on us.v80 across: absent; all-0x00;
   all-0xFF; all-0xAA; 512 random bytes; a random-but-checksum-valid image; a
   fully-maxed valid image; a real save written by the Adventure route; and 11
   truncation lengths (0, 1, 8, 39, 40, 100, 119, 120, 200, 320, 511). **Every one
   reaches `menu_init menuId=0` (MENU_TITLE) at frame 1134**, having loaded only
   levelId 39 (OPTIONSBACKGROUND, behind MENU_BOOT), 21 (FRONTEND, behind
   MENU_LOGOS) and 23 (TITLESCREENSEQUENCE, the title's own backdrop) — identical
   to the no-save boot. The race-looking loads a healthy idle boot *does* make are
   the ordinary **attract demos**, `levelId=18` (Greenwood Village) at frame ~5132
   and `levelId=28` (Frosty Village) at ~6632, `numPlayers=0 cutscene=100`,
   loaded via `load_level_for_menu()` from `menu_title_screen_loop()` on the
   title-demo timer. Those are camera-only demos and exit on START.

Also checked and cleared:

- **Does a bad checksum fail SAFE or into the resume path? SAFE.**
  `populate_settings_from_save_data()` calls `clear_game_progress()` (which sets
  `newGame = TRUE`) *before* it validates, and clears `newGame` only inside the
  `var_a0 == 0` branch. `read_save_file()` then calls `erase_save_file()`, which
  rewrites the slot to 0xFF. Worth knowing: that means **one bad byte silently
  destroys that save slot on the next boot** — faithful to the ROM, and the reason
  the quarantine below exists.
- **Is a test hook live in the shipped web build?** Not the ones this report
  needed ruled out — but the answer is no longer "the page writes exactly one env
  var". Emscripten seeds `getEnvStrings()` with
  `{USER, LOGNAME, PATH, PWD, HOME, LANG, _}` plus `Module.ENV`, and
  `grep -o "MDKR_[A-Z_0-9]*" dist/web/mdkr64_web.js` returns **nothing** — the
  loader never mentions one. `dist/web/mdkr64-shell.js`'s `preRun` now sets
  `MDKR_TRACE` (from `?trace=`), `MDKR_OBJCOLL`, `MDKR_LOAD_TRACK`, and any
  `MDKR_[A-Z0-9_]+` key carried by a `testConfig.env` object, each value truncated
  to 256 bytes. `MDKR_DRIVE_ROUTE`, `MDKR_AUTOPILOT` and `MDKR_FORCE_LAPS` remain
  unreachable from the page, and `MDKR_TRACE` only enables logging. **Re-read the
  `preRun` block before using this to rule anything out — the list has grown
  once already.**
- **Adventure-2 mismatch at FILE SELECT is not a strand.** A save with
  `cutsceneFlags & CUTSCENE_ADVENTURE_TWO` cannot be entered from normal
  Adventure: `fileselect_input_root()` (`menu.c:7857`) plays
  `SOUND_HORN_DRUMSTICK` and `break`s. An A-tap-only fixture therefore sits there
  for ever, which looked like a wedge — but B still returns to GAME SELECT and
  ERASE still works, so it is a *fixture* artifact, not a trap. Recorded because
  it will look like a hang again the next time a fixture only presses A.

### Defect 1 — the save image was accepted at any length (platform)
`eeprom_load()` (`platform/stubs_dkr.c`) did `fread(s_eeprom, 1, 512, f)` and
ignored the count, so a short file was interpreted with its missing tail read as
zeros. A short file is not hypothetical: the old `eeprom_store()` opened with
`fopen(path, "wb")`, which **truncates before anything is written**, so a crash
inside the store left 0..511 bytes on disk — and on the web build the file comes
back out of IndexedDB, where a killed tab or an interrupted `FS.syncfs` can do the
same. Two changes:

- **Atomic store.** Write `save/eeprom.bin.tmp`, then `rename()` it over
  `save/eeprom.bin`. Atomic on POSIX and a single node swap in emscripten's FS, so
  the real file is never *observed* short; an interrupted store leaves the previous
  good image plus a stray `.tmp`.
- **Validating load.** The image is a fixed table of independently-checksummed
  blocks (`save_layout.h`: 3×`SaveFile`(40) | `SaveConfig`(8) | `CourseRecords`(192)×2).
  Require exactly 512 bytes, and require every block to be erased (all 0xFF), blank
  (all 0x00) or checksum-valid. Anything else is copied verbatim to
  **`save/eeprom.bin.bad`** and replaced in memory with the state the game itself
  defines for empty: 0xFF for a slot (`erase_save_file()`'s own marker), 0x00 for
  config/records (which then fail their own checksums and are ignored).

The checksum rules mirror `save_data.c` exactly (`populate_settings_from_save_data`
/ `func_80073588`: big-endian u16 at [0..1] == `(5 + Σ bytes[2..n)) & 0xFFFF`;
`read_eeprom_settings`: byte 0 == `5 +` the nibble sum of the low 56 bits). This is
**behaviour-neutral for every image DKR can produce** — a valid block is passed
through untouched, and a blanked block is one the game already rejected on its own
checksum. Verified: a valid image produces no `[SAVE]` line and no `.bad` file, and
`check_race_finish_time` still records and reads back its course time.

### Defect 2 — a checksum-VALID slot with an impossible field SIGSEGVs, every boot
The slot checksum is a plain 16-bit byte sum, which corrupt bytes satisfy by
chance. Fuzzing 40 randomly-corrupted images through the Adventure resume route:
**4 of 40 crashed with SIGSEGV**, all four in
`func_80054FD0` ← `func_8004F7F4` ← `update_player_racer` ← `obj_update`. A
leave-one-out over the decoded fields put every one of them on a single field:

```
drop wizpig     : 0        <- only this one removes the crash
drop <any other>: -11
```

and a per-value sweep (others zeroed) isolates it exactly:

| `wizpigAmulet` | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| exit code | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | **−11** | 0 | **−11** |

`settings->wizpigAmulet` is **3 bits on disk** (0..7) but the amulet has **four**
pieces — `game.c:521` tests `wizpigAmulet >= 4`, `vehicle_tricky.c:366` uses
`wizpigAmulet - 1` as a 0..3 cutscene index — so 5..7 cannot come from play.
`objects.c:2308` (`BHV_DYNAMIC_LIGHT_OBJECT_2`) then does

```c
i = settings->wizpigAmulet;
assetCount = i + 1;
curObj->modelIndex = settings->wizpigAmulet;
```

with **no clamp against the object's `numberOfModelIds`**, so the spawner loads
out-of-range model ids on Timber's Island and the racer collision path dereferences
the result ~750 frames later. (6 survives only because its overrun happens to land
on benign bytes — the field is unbounded, not "mostly fine".) Every other field at
its maximum representable value survives the same route: `tajFlags` 0x3F,
`trophies` 0x3FF, `bosses` 0xFFF, `keys` 0xFF, balloons 127×6, door flags
0xFFFF×6, all courses cleared, `filename` 0xFFFF, `cutsceneFlags` 0xFFFFFFFF.

**Why this is the worst shape for the demo:** the save lives in IndexedDB, so it is
crash → reload → same save → crash, for ever, and until this wave the page had no
control that clears saved progress.

**Fixed** in `populate_settings_from_save_data()` under `NATIVE_PORT`: a slot with
`ttAmulet > 4 || wizpigAmulet > 4` is rejected with the function's own idiom for
"this is not a save" — `clear_game_progress()`, leaving `newGame = TRUE` — so
`read_save_file()` erases the slot and FILE SELECT offers an unstarted file. Scope
is deliberately narrow (the one field the fuzz proved fatal). ~~**The deeper fix
belongs with the object code: clamp `modelIndex`/`assetCount` against
`numberOfModelIds` in `objects.c`.** Left open here on purpose — `objects.c` was
being edited concurrently by the boss-race wave.~~ **DONE in wave "core-safety":**
the character, trophy, amulet and rocket-signpost selectors in `spawn_object()`
all go through one final-use resolver, `mdkr_model_load_selection()`, which
validates the save-derived value against that object header's own
`numberOfModelIds` and selects nothing when it fails. The save-side rejection here
is kept as the narrower belt.

Post-fix the same 40-image fuzz is **0/40 anomalous**, and `wizpigAmulet` 0..7 all
exit 0.

### Defect 3 — two independent `FS.syncfs` coalescers in one page (web)
`FS.syncfs` is not reentrant. The engine's post-EEPROM-write `EM_ASM`
(`stubs_dkr.c`) guarded on `Module.__mdkrSyncing`; the shell's `persist()` guarded
on its own module-local `syncing`. **Neither knew about the other**, so the shell's
5-second timer could start a sync while an EEPROM-write sync was in flight. The
shell now installs its coalescer as `Module.__mdkrPersist` and the engine calls it,
so the whole page shares one in-flight sync and one error path (the save banner).
The engine keeps a local fallback for when it runs without the shell.

### Browser recovery path — there was none, now there is
`dist/web/index.html` gains a **"Stored data" section (step 04)** with an
**Erase saved progress** button (`#clear-save`, `.btn-danger`, `confirm()`-gated,
status in `#save-status`), separate from the ROM control and cross-referenced from
the "Saves persist" bullet in step 02. It talks to **IndexedDB directly** rather
than through the engine — deliberately, because the state that needs erasing is the
state the engine crashes on, and a recovery path that needs a working engine is no
recovery path. IDBFS names its database after the mount point (`/rom`, `/save`) and
keeps files in one `FILE_DATA` store; clearing that store in a plain readwrite
transaction works even while the engine holds a connection, which
`deleteDatabase()` does not (it blocks).

Two pre-existing shell defects were found while wiring it and are fixed in the same
pass, because the new control is meaningless next to a dead one:

- **"Forget stored ROM" was unreachable *and* did nothing.** Nothing ever set
  `$("forget").hidden = false`, and the handler instantiated a *second* engine
  module, never mounted IDBFS on it, and unlinked a path that did not exist there —
  so it downloaded the whole engine and deleted nothing.
- **A persisted ROM could not be used.** `#play` was only enabled by picking a
  file, so "the ROM persists across reloads" was true of the storage and false of
  the UI: a returning visitor had to re-pick the ROM every time. `probeStoredRom()`
  now counts the `/rom` store at startup and enables Play / reveals Forget.

### Defect 4 — a Taj challenge you have already beaten is replayed, and wedges you
**This is the defect behind the report, once the symptom was corrected.** The
first description in the report was "boots into a race"; the correction was: *"It doesn't
boot direct into a race — after navigating all screens, it boots into a genie test,
which we already completed."* So: normal menu navigation, Adventure, and then a
**Taj challenge** that was already finished.

`tajFlags` (6 bits in `SaveFile`) holds two parallel triples:

| | car | hover | plane |
|---|---|---|---|
| **OFFERED** (Taj has proposed it) | `0x01` | `0x02` | `0x04` |
| **BEATEN** (finished first) | `0x08` | `0x10` | `0x20` |

They are written at two different moments by two different functions:
`track_setup_racers()` (`objects.c:1807`) sets OFFERED when Taj teleports over,
and `mode_end_taj_race()` (`objects.c:10744`) sets BEATEN on a first-place finish.
Each calls `safe_mark_write_save_file()` separately, and on the web each is
followed by its own IDBFS sync.

**The offer gate consults only the OFFERED half** (`objects.c:1794`:
`!(tajFlags & TAJ_FLAGS_CAR_CHAL_UNLOCKED) && balloonsPtr[0] >= miscAsset16[0]`),
and **the auto-offer dialogue never asks**: `DIALOGUEPAGE_TAJ_CHALLENGE_CAR` falls
straight through to `DIALOGUEPAGE_TAJ_4`, which returns
`(gNextTajChallengeMenu - 1) | 0x40` and starts the race. So a save reading
"beaten but never offered" replays a finished challenge on **every** entry to
Timber's Island — and because `obj_loop_parkwarden()` calls
`disable_racer_input()` every frame its dialogue is open (and that dialogue cannot
be advanced from the pad — see P3.5 Part C), the player is simply stopped.

Measured on us.v80, `adventure_hub_drive.txt`, 12000 frames, 9909 post-hub
`[PACE]` rows, with `balloonsPtr[0] = 5` (= `ASSET_MISC_16[0]`, the car threshold):

| `tajFlags` | path driven | rows stationary |
|---|---|---|
| `0x00` (nothing) | 37767.6 | 2406 (24 %) |
| `0x09` (offered + beaten — consistent) | 37767.6 | 2406 (24 %) |
| **`0x08` (beaten, never offered)** | **14439.4** | **7525 (76 %)** |

**Fixed** at the save-read seam, in `populate_settings_from_save_data()` under
`NATIVE_PORT`, one line: `tajFlags |= (tajFlags >> 3) & TAJ_FLAGS_UNLOCKED_A_CHALLENGE`.
The implication holds in one direction only, which is what makes it a repair
rather than a guess — a challenge cannot be beaten without having been offered —
so it can only ever restore a bit play must already have set. It never sets a
BEATEN bit, it is idempotent, and it is a **no-op on every consistent save**
(verified for `0x00/0x01/0x03/0x07/0x09/0x1B/0x1F/0x3F`). The write-side cause is
Defect 3 above (two independent `FS.syncfs` coalescers, so one of the two progress
flushes could be lost); this is the belt to that braces.

#### What was measured and ruled OUT along the way
- **Taj completion IS persisted and IS read back.** `tajFlags` round-trips
  correctly: injected `0x01/0x03/0x07/0x09/0x1B/0x1F/0x3F` all reappear in
  `save/eeprom.bin` after a hub visit. "Never written" was the cheapest
  explanation and it is wrong.
- **The write goes to the right slot.** With the started file in **slot 1** and a
  RIGHT press at FILE SELECT, the progress landed in slot 1; slots 0 and 2 stayed
  erased. `get_save_file_index()` is `gSaveFileIndex`, and its two resets
  (`menu_title_screen_init`, `menu_file_select_init`) both precede the pick.
- **`1 << (j + 31)` was right on this host — by luck.** `track_setup_racers`
  (`objects.c`) relied on MIPS masking the shift count to 5 bits. Probed directly:
  j=1/2/3 yield `0x1/0x2/0x4`, i.e. arm64's register shift masks identically. It
  is now `DKR_SHL32` — see the resolved item below.
- **The `ttAmulet`/`wizpigAmulet > 4` rejection added in this wave is NOT a false
  positive.** Both writers clamp: `objects.c:6597` (`i = ttAmulet + 1; if (i > 4)
  i = 4;`) and `vehicle_tricky.c:387` (`worldBit++; if (worldBit >= 5) worldBit =
  4;`), so play cannot produce 5..7. Measured: a save with `tajFlags = 0x3F`,
  `ttAmulet = 4`, `wizpigAmulet = 4` and 18 balloons survives untouched
  (`valid=True`, `erased=False`, `tajFlags` still `0x3f`). It cannot erase real
  progress.
- **It is NOT the `gTrackSelectIDs[4][6]` / `gFFLUnlocked` arbitrary-level load**
  (wave "splitsweep"). Two independent reasons, both checked:
  1. **Measured.** Re-run on top of that fix, the Taj wedge reproduces with
     byte-identical numbers (14439.4 / 76 % reverted, 37767.6 / 24 % fixed). The
     repro route never visits TRACK SELECT at all — TITLE → CHARACTER_SELECT →
     CAUTION → GAME_SELECT → **Adventure** → FILE_SELECT → resume → hub.
  2. **By construction.** There is no Taj level id: `grep ASSET_LEVEL.*taj`
     over `asset_enums.h` returns nothing, because a challenge runs *in place* on
     `ASSET_LEVEL_CENTRALAREAHUB` with `levelHeader->race_type` switched and
     restored by `mode_end_taj_race()`. An arbitrary level id can therefore only
     ever produce a random *race track*, never "a genie test". And the Taj offer
     block is gated `if (is_in_tracks_mode() == FALSE)`, so Tracks mode cannot
     reach it either. Both defects are real; they are different defects, and this
     is the one that matches the corrected symptom.

### ~~NEW OPEN ITEM: five sites depend on MIPS masking the shift count~~ — CLOSED by wave "keyshift"
`1 << (j + 31)` is how the decomp renders code that relied on MIPS's `sllv`
masking the shift amount to 5 bits, i.e. `1 << ((j + 31) & 31)`. In C a shift of
32 or more is **undefined behaviour**. Five sites:

| site | expression as this wave found it |
|---|---|
| `objects.c` `track_setup_racers` | `settings->tajFlags \|= 1 << (j + 31)` |
| `game.c` `level_load` | `!(cutsceneFlags & (CUTSCENE_DINO_DOMAIN_KEY << (var_s0 + 31)))` |
| `game.c` `level_load` | `cutsceneFlags \|= CUTSCENE_DINO_DOMAIN_KEY << (var_s0 + 31)` |
| `game.c` `level_load` | `var_s0 = 8 << (settings->worldId + 31)` |
| `waves.c` `obj_wave_height` | `var_t0 <<= (log->unk2 + 0x1F)` |

All four progress-flag sites were probed as **currently correct** on arm64
(measured `0x1/0x2/0x4` for j=1/2/3), because arm64's variable shift also masks
modulo 32 and clang emitted a register shift rather than folding. That was luck,
not portability — and worse than latent: wave "keyshift" then showed that at `-O2`
clang folds the statement away outright, and the port's *web* build is Release, so
this was the live, reported "key cutscene replays after every race" defect.

**All five sites (plus one more the shift-syntax sweep found) now go through
`DKR_SHL32(x, n)`** in `game/include/macros.h`, which reproduces `sllv` for every
count; `MDKR_SHL32_CONTROL` selects the reverted form for
`tests/check_key_cutscene_once.py`'s broken arm. The suggested detector shipped
with it: `-fsanitize=shift-exponent` is in `tests/check_array_bounds_sweep.py`'s
instrumented build, with a required `__ubsan_handle_shift_out_of_bounds` import so
an empty report cannot be confused with a dropped flag. Full write-up:
[collision.md class 3](collision.md#class-3--a-variable-shift-count-that-can-reach-32).

### Check
`tests/check_save_failsafe.py` — five cases, headless and muted, each starting
from a known EEPROM state. Under `tools/run_checks.py` it writes into a
run-scoped temporary save directory (`MDKR_TEST_SAVE_DIR`, exported to the engine
as `MDKR_SAVE_DIR`); a standalone run defaults to the repository's `save/` and
restores every EEPROM artifact it found, however it exits. A leftover save would
otherwise send FILE SELECT down the resume path and break
`check_adventure_hub.py`. Paths below are relative to whichever save directory is
in effect:

1. **torn** (100 of 512 bytes) → title screen at 1134, nothing but the three boot
   levels loaded, `eeprom.bin.bad` byte-identical to the input, `eeprom.bin` back to
   512 bytes.
2. **garbage** (512 random bytes) → same.
3. **poison** — `wizpigAmulet = 7` in slot 0, *valid* started slots with a complete
   amulet (4) in slots 1 and 2 → exit 0, no `[CRASH]`, FILE SELECT reached (proving
   the file was read), slot 0 erased, **slots 1 and 2 byte-for-byte untouched**.
   That last assertion is what keeps the case honest: an absent save cannot satisfy
   it, and neither can a fix that rejects the whole image instead of the one bad
   slot.
4. **control, no save at all** → clean boot, and **no** `.bad` and no `.tmp` file,
   which is what stops cases 1–2 passing vacuously.
5. **taj** — `tajFlags = 0x08` (car challenge beaten, never offered) with 5
   balloons, driven for 12000 frames → the kart must still cover ≥ 25000 units of
   Timber's Island and be stationary for ≤ 45 % of the post-hub rows. Measured by
   *driving*, because the damage is a held-down input, not a crash: healthy
   37767.6 / 24 %, wedged 14439.4 / 76 %. It also asserts levelId 0 loaded, so a
   route change that stopped resuming the file fails loudly instead of covering
   nothing.

Proven in both directions by running the controls, not by reasoning:

| reverted | failures |
|---|---|
| `eeprom_load()` validation (`platform/stubs_dkr.c`) | `torn: save/eeprom.bin.bad was not created`; `torn: save/eeprom.bin is 100 bytes after the run, expected 512`; `garbage: save/eeprom.bin.bad was not created` |
| amulet rejection (`game/src/save_data.c`) | `poison: run produced [CRASH]/[FATAL]`; `poison: run exited -11 (killed by signal 11)`; `poison: slot 0 was not erased (first bytes 002c00000000)` |
| BEATEN-implies-OFFERED repair (`game/src/save_data.c`) | `taj: the kart only drove 14439.4 units (need >= 25000.0)`; `taj: the kart was stationary for 76% of the run (limit 45%)` |

`check_determinism`, `check_race_drive`, `check_race_finish_time` (course time
4777 on the current route), `check_adventure_hub` and `check_adventure_race_loop`
all still pass.
