# Audio — the clean-room engine and the software mixer

Music, SFX and reverb are live. This document describes how audio actually
works today; [NOTICE.md](../../NOTICE.md) and
[THIRD_PARTY.md](../../THIRD_PARTY.md) are canonical for provenance and
licensing, and are the documents to trust if this one ever drifts.

## What runs

DKR's audio is synthesised in software on the host. There is no RSP and no
audio thread.

1. **The engine.** `platform/audio_*.c` implement the libaudio surface, one
   file per stage: `audio_bank.c` (bank and sequence-file parsing),
   `audio_sequence.c` (the MIDI readers), `audio_envmix.c` (envelope
   mixing), `audio_fx.c` (the reverb delay lines), `audio_filters.c`
   (ADPCM/RAW16 loading, resampling, the buses), `audio_synth.c` (the
   synthesis driver), `audio_seqplayer.c` and `audio_cspplayer.c` (the
   compact sequence player), with `audio_compat.c` holding the engine
   globals and the DKR extensions and `audio_compat_internal.h` the little
   that crosses between them; alongside them `platform/audio_event_queue.c`
   is the event queue and `platform/audio_fx_transfer.c` the reverb
   delay-line transfer planner. This is first-party
   clean-room code, brought over from the sister **mgb64** project and
   extended here with a DKR extensions section (19 functions: the CC7/CC8
   dual channel-volume lanes and their accessors, the reverb gate and
   guard-trip readout, the aux-bus re-parent helper, channel on/off, voice
   limit, and pan modes), plus in-engine adaptations for DKR's `fxType[2]`
   dual aux buses, the `CSP_CHAN()` channel-state stride, and an
   arena-resident `alHeapDBAlloc`.

2. **The mixer.** The engine builds an `Acmd` list using libultra's `abi.h`
   command macros (`aADPCMdec`, `aEnvMixer`, `aResample`, `aSetBuffer`,
   `aMix`, …). `platform/mixer.h` `#undef`s those macros and redefines each to
   call the software RSP audio-microcode emulator in `platform/mixer.c`
   directly (`mixerADPCMdec`, `mixerEnvMixer`, …). So on this port "building
   the Acmd list" **is** "executing the synthesis" — there is no separate Acmd
   interpreter. `platform/mixer.c` is adapted from the perfect_dark port; DKR,
   GoldenEye and Perfect Dark all share the libultra N-Audio ABI.

3. **Addressing.** The synth ABI truncates every address to 32 bits
   (`osVirtualToPhysical` → `u32`, the `ALDMAproc` return → `s32`,
   `ALSave.dramout` → `(s32)param`). All audio memory is therefore
   arena-resident, and `MIXER_RESOLVE` / `dkr_lo32_to_ptr` reconstructs each
   mixer address from its low 32 bits — the same pattern the graphics path
   uses.

4. **The pump and the sink.** An independently due synchronous pump
   (`platform/audi_port_dkr.c` plus `amAudioSynthFrame`) replaces the
   never-run audio thread. Exact host-audio time accrues in two-field quanta;
   each ordered game tick consumes at most one, so extra presentation frames
   cannot manufacture PCM and catch-up retains cue order. Native output is an
   SDL2 queue-mode device at 22050 Hz stereo s16, gated off under
   `--headless-frames` unless the test-only `MDKR_TEST_HEADLESS_AUDIO=1` is
   explicitly paired with a controlled sink such as `SDL_AUDIODRIVER=dummy`.
   `platform/audio_queue_controller.c` replaces the
   measured sink drain and corrects the application queue toward a bounded
   target; the same pure controller drives deterministic cadence tests and a
   ROM-free SDL sink probe. The browser build swaps the sink for
   `web_audio_worklet.c`; sample production is decoupled from the sink so both
   reuse it.

## Sink qualification

Two ROM-free CTests separate deterministic control from operating-system
plumbing. `audio_queue_controller` simulates exact 30, 60, 120, 144, 240 and
1000 Hz service schedules plus counter wrap, capacity/alignment, and a long
host stall. `audio_sink_contract` opens the real SDL queue API with silence,
requires the exact 22050 Hz/stereo/s16 contract, observes active drain, and
checks bounded occupancy plus pause and clear behavior. CI selects SDL's
silent `dummy` driver. The same executable can exercise a physical default
device without copyrighted PCM or audible output:

```bash
env -u SDL_AUDIODRIVER build/mdkr_audio_sink_contract_test --duration-ms 10000
```

The 2026-08-01 CoreAudio witness passed for 5 seconds: 476 controller calls,
214 observed queue drains, zero queue failures or stall guards, and a
1,193-sample-frame application-queue high-water. SDL queue occupancy does not
expose the hidden hardware buffer and silence cannot prove speaker output, so
this is not represented as DAC underrun, audible-output, or cross-platform
hardware qualification. Those remain part of the physical release matrix.

## Player volume and sink continuity

Native Settings exposes persistent master, music, and effects volume. Music and
effects are synchronized into the game's original mix buses, including sounds
that are already playing; redundant pending global-volume events are coalesced
so a held slider cannot exhaust the event queue. Master volume is applied after
synthesis with a perceptual square-law curve, a 256-frame ramp, and an exact
unity fast path. It can only attenuate, so the control cannot introduce clipping
above the game mixer's output.

Dragging an audio slider publishes a non-persistent audible preview. Releasing
it performs one atomic configuration save; canceling or leaving Settings
restores the committed mix. The SDL sink admits at most two seconds of queued
PCM, checks queue failures, and crossfades from the last accepted sample after a
drop or failed queue operation. Diagnostic WAV/RMS capture intentionally occurs
before that sink-only recovery crossfade, so audio-oracle files continue to
describe deterministic synthesizer output rather than host-device history. For
a native sink investigation, `MDKR_AUDIO_SINK_DUMP=/path/accepted.wav` creates
a separate WAV containing only PCM blocks for which `SDL_QueueAudio` returned
success, after any recovery crossfade. Its shutdown line records accepted,
repaired, rejected, and emergency-dropped block counts. It is evidence of bytes
SDL accepted into its application queue, not later device mixing, DAC output,
speakers, or hotplug behaviour; those still require the physical release matrix.

## Provenance: what the engine replaced

Audio originally ran on 49 decompiled SGI-legend synthesiser sources under
`game/libultra/src/audio/`. **Those were deleted** at the clean-room swap
(commit `2a180eb`); nothing derived from the SGI implementation ships. The
engine described above replaced them wholesale.

The swap was validated as a behavioural no-op, not asserted to be one. Against
the pre-swap capture baseline:

| Measure | Result |
|---|---|
| Whole-capture RMS | within **0.27 dB** of baseline |
| Reverb-off RMS | within **0.43 dB** of baseline |
| Spectral cosine similarity | **1.000** |
| Per-band mean absolute error | **0.36 dB** |

Measured by `tools/compare_audio.py` / `tools/compare_audio_reference.py`
(themselves ported from mgb64) via the `check_audio_output` and
`check_raw16_audio` fixtures.

One behavioural difference had to be corrected during that validation and is
worth knowing about: mgb64's `alEnvmixerParam` applies a square-law
perceptual volume curve `(v*v)>>15`; DKR's synthesiser applies volume
**linearly**. Inheriting the curve cost roughly 4 dB overall and, being
quadratic, attenuated quiet voices far more than loud ones. It is now linear
here (commit `cdeb3e5`), which is what closed the gap in the table above.
