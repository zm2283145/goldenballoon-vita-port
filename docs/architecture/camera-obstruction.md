This is the implementation authority and living evidence record for the
camera-penetration defect. Target, implemented, and release-evidenced behavior
are distinguished explicitly.

## 1. Product decision

The native port will treat camera obstruction as a correctness boundary, not a
visual preset:

- A player-facing camera may not enter a hard visual occluder or expose geometry
  between the eye and its near plane.
- The existing DKR camera behaviors continue to author the desired shot. A native
  resolver produces the safe shot after every behavior, dialogue offset, and shake
  contribution is known.
- Safety is on by default in Pure, Restored, and Remastered modes — written as a
  target here, and **not yet true**: it was true for part of 2026-08-07 and was
  reverted to opt-in that day by device acceptance (§10.1). Pure remains an
  image-treatment/reference preset; it is not permission to retain a disruptive
  camera defect. No preset pins the key in either direction, so a player's
  choice of camera survives every mode switch. A same-binary legacy mode exists
  only for diagnostics, fidelity comparisons, and the required broken-direction
  test.
- Resolution and pixel density never change the world-space camera. Effective
  aspect ratio, viewport shape, authored FOV, user FOV, and the horizontal FOV cap
  do, because they change the lens volume that must remain clear.
- The resolver is fixed-tick authority. Rendering consumes the resolved camera and
  never moves it. Window/FOV changes are latched so rendering cannot use a
  projection that has not been safety-validated.
- Vehicle physics and gameplay collision remain unchanged. Camera queries are
  pure: no interaction flags, door state, racer velocity, RNG, or object order may
  be written.
- Display aspect, FOV, resolution, and obstruction correction may not alter racer
  simulation or RNG. Presentation visibility uses the resolved camera; the legacy
  AI-activity admission gets an explicit canonical logical-camera basis.

This follows the standard spring-arm model—preserve an unobstructed desired boom,
retract on contact, recover when clear—but sweeps the lens guard instead of a
ray. Unreal exposes a camera-specific probe, probe size, desired
unfixed position, collision displacement, and lag state in its
[SpringArmComponent](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/unreal-engine/API/Runtime/Engine/USpringArmComponent?lang=en-US).
Godot explicitly recommends sweeping the camera's near-plane pyramid because a
ray is inaccurate for camera collision in its
[SpringArm3D guidance](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/3d/spring_arm.html).
Those are design benchmarks, not dependencies.

## 2. Legacy mechanism and confirmed root cause

The defect is systemic:

1. `update_player_camera()` selects car, plane, hovercraft, loop, fixed, finish, or
   challenge behavior. Each behavior writes a desired world position directly;
   none performs an obstruction query.
2. Dialogue translation and shake then modify camera position after the selected
   behavior returns. A fix inside only `update_camera_car()` would therefore be
   incomplete.
3. Mode transitions can invoke `update_player_camera()` twice in one tick. A
   temporal solver placed there could integrate twice.
4. Most behaviors update `cameraSegmentID` before the late translations. Fixed and
   finish modes use the racer's Y rather than the camera's Y. Scene visibility is
   then seeded from a potentially stale or wrong segment.
5. `func_80027568()` does detect some terrain between a racer and camera, but only
   on levels with `useVoid`, and it excludes several camera modes. Its response is
   `void_check()`: synthesize a flat-colour curtain to hide the hole. It does not
   move the camera.
6. That detector queries terrain collision facets only. It does not include doors,
   props, or moving object models.
7. The shared gameplay terrain query keeps only the first ten overlapping level
   segments and writes a global 500-entry scratch list. The gameplay object query
   uses a separately capped list and writes interaction state. Neither is a safe
   or complete camera API.
8. The renderer's historical HLE near-plane defect is already fixed. Renderer
   clipping correctly clips a triangle after it reaches the lens; it cannot keep
   the eye outside the triangle.

A deterministic Ancient Lake witness reaches the canyon wall at frame 7700 and
holds the racer at `(-3040.91528, 29, -6474.04688)`. The captured view is dominated
and bisected by the adjacent wall. This is a useful visual witness, but final
acceptance must be based on geometric invariants as well as pixels.

### 2.1 Current implementation snapshot

- A native-only finalizer runs once per selected physical camera slot after the
  authored T.T. camera and before logical sort/LOD/visibility authority.
- All eight `gCameras` slots are snapshotted. Correction is published only to a
  presentation sidecar; gameplay, AI, audio event logic, and state hashes retain
  the authored cameras.
- The resolver latches the per-viewport render projection, guards the
  presentation lens of that same viewport, derives a
  conservative lens-enclosing sphere, and composes immutable static-track and
  dynamic hard-object queries without per-tick allocation. The exact two-phase
  result is authoritative for every Modern final-pose path; the enclosing sphere
  remains its conservative broad phase and fallback. Dynamic model queries use a
  deterministic immutable BVH for both enclosing-sphere and exact phases, with
  aggregate instance/node/chunk/triangle/stationary-test fences. Every final
  renderer pose/fallback tuple is sealed only after exact endpoint validation.
  The complete release matrix remains default-on blocking.
- Render view, distance, billboard/ortho tilt, model-relative calculations, and
  snapshots consume the scoped resolved camera. The render projection generation
  is checked against the fixed-tick validation record.
- Modern mode retracts immediately, recovers at a bounded fixed-step rate, tests a
  deterministic shoulder/elevation fan, recomputes the resolved segment and
  orientation, and can apply a per-viewport presentation-only racer fade when no
  readable boom fits.
- `legacy` and `center-ray` remain same-binary positive controls. Modern is the
  default arm and the fallback for an unrecognised policy value; Observe retains
  the authored pose and is the player-facing opt-out.

### The 14-unit clue

The old detector subtracts 14 units from the camera-to-facet plane distance. That
number closely matches the stock lens:

```text
near = 10
vertical FOV = 60 degrees
aspect = 4/3
half-height = near * tan(vfov / 2)             = 5.7735
half-width  = half-height * aspect             = 7.6980
eye-to-near-corner = sqrt(near^2 + w^2 + h^2) = 13.88
```

The likely intent was therefore clearance for the original near-plane pyramid,
not merely a point camera. It does not generalize: 16:9, 21:9, portrait, split
viewports, authored zooms, user FOV, and the horizontal cap produce different
near-plane dimensions. The detector also uses the value only to decide whether to
draw the void curtain.

## 3. Red-team findings: ways a plausible fix would still fail

These are release blockers, not optional refinements.

| Tempting implementation | Why it fails |
|---|---|
| Raycast from racer origin to camera center | A clear center ray does not prove that the near plane or its edges are clear; the racer origin is also not the authored focus/pivot. |
| Fixed 14-unit sphere | Correctly hints at stock 4:3, but is too small for wider/FOV-adjusted lenses and unnecessarily conservative for some narrow projections. |
| Call `collision_objectmodel()` | It mutates gameplay interaction state, sees only the capped gameplay object set, and can perturb doors or other behaviors. |
| Reuse `generate_collision_candidates()` | Long booms can cross more than ten segments; the 500-entry global list can truncate and is shared mutable scratch. |
| Use only gameplay collision triangles | Visible `NO_COLLISION` scenery can still cover the camera; conversely water, decals, foliage, and cutouts should not all behave as hard walls. |
| Resolve inside each vehicle camera function | Dialogue/shake can move the eye afterward, transition updates can solve twice, and seven camera modes would drift apart. |
| Clamp immediately in both directions | Safe, but visually pops and chatters at triangle seams. Safety needs immediate retraction and intentionally slower, hysteretic expansion. |
| Smooth the corrected XYZ and feed it back as desired | The camera can accumulate error, lag behind authored behavior, or stay trapped after an obstruction clears. Desired and resolved state must remain separate. |
| Change `CAMERA_NEAR` or disable renderer clipping | Changes depth precision and symptoms, not the eye/world intersection. |
| Compute from output pixels | Makes 1080p and 4K cameras differ at the same aspect. Only projection geometry matters. |
| Read aspect/FOV during render | A resize can widen the render lens after the last safety solve. Projection and pose require one generation contract. |
| Resolve only gameplay cameras 0–3 | Cutscene cameras 4–7, P2 promotion, and the 3P T.T. spectator viewport can still select an unresolved bank. |
| Treat every visible triangle as hard | Foliage, water, decals, translucent effects, small signs, and fences can force nauseating close-ups or jitter. |
| Fade every obstruction | Fading a canyon wall or locked door destroys spatial trust and can expose the level void. Fade is only a soft-occluder policy. |
| Let render interpolation lerp safe endpoints | The chord between two safe poses can cross a wall. Any future high-rate camera sampling must revalidate the sampled lens or declare a discontinuity. |
| Ignore camera-driven simulation | `obj_visibility_tick()` uses each camera frustum to refresh a racer timer that gates AI steering and RNG. Changing the camera can change gameplay unless authority is explicit and tested. |

## 4. User-experience contract

### 4.1 Hard guarantees

- No hard occluder intersects the effective eye-to-near-plane lens guard.
- No non-overlap hard occluder blocks the required target-to-eye corridor after
  resolution, except a documented cinematic shot that intentionally hides its
  target. A focus point embedded in hard geometry is separately not-visible
  telemetry and an unavailable composition constraint, never a claimed clear
  corridor.
- Retraction is fast enough that a single fixed-tick move cannot expose the inside
  of a wall. Expansion is smooth, bounded, and cannot oscillate across a seam.
- The racer remains readable. If no third-person pose can fit, use deterministic
  emergency framing and racer fade rather than placing the eye in a wall.
- Open-space camera transforms remain byte-identical to the pre-fix native path.
- One aspect ratio at two resolutions produces the same camera trace.
- Each split-screen viewport resolves independently with no final-viewport
  contamination.

### 4.2 Desired feel

The priority order is:

1. physical safety;
2. target/racer visibility;
3. continuity with the prior resolved shot;
4. closeness to the authored desired shot;
5. maximum useful boom length.

The camera retracts immediately when danger increases. It returns more slowly when
space opens, and it does not start returning the instant the corridor reports
clear: a retraction stays engaged until the corridor has been clear for a whole
release window, because a swept lens volume grazing a wall reports clear for a
few ticks at facet seams and at shallow incidence, and expanding on that report
pops the boom toward the authored pose and snaps it back on the next tick. The
window is nine authored ticks, taken from the longest measured false-clear run
plus one tick of margin, and it is deliberately shorter than the chatter window
MOTION-01 asserts on, so the assertion still has something to catch. Retraction
itself is never delayed by it: measured retract latency is zero and stays zero.
Obstruction correction must not add general camera lag: DKR's existing vehicle
cameras already author their own speed-sensitive feel.

### 4.3 Screen and viewport behavior

| Configuration | Required behavior |
|---|---|
| 4:3 reference | Stock composition in open space; dynamically derived guard should land near the historical 14-unit intent. |
| 16:9 / 16:10 | Hor+ composition retained; wider near plane is fully protected. |
| 21:9 / 32:9 | Use the actual horizontally capped projection. Prefer exact lens-guard narrow phase so a conservative sphere does not over-retract. |
| Portrait / narrow browser window | Use the actual narrow projection; no resolution-dependent boom changes. HUD safe area is unrelated to camera collision. |
| 2P top/bottom | Respect DKR's full-height viewport plus scissor behavior and the projection helper's existing policy. Do not infer projection from the scissor alone. |
| 3P / 4P | Resolve all gameplay viewports plus the optional 3P T.T. camera using the actual selected camera IDs. |
| HiDPI / SSAA 1x–4x | Identical world-space result at a fixed aspect/FOV. |
| Live resize / FOV change | Apply a new pose and projection atomically on the next authored camera generation; never render an unvalidated wider lens. |

## 5. Target architecture

### 5.1 Data model

Do not change the original `Camera` layout. Add native sidecar state for all eight
camera slots:

```c
typedef struct MdkrCameraObstructionState {
    Vec3f desired_eye;
    Vec3f resolved_eye;
    Vec3f last_safe_eye;
    Vec3f pivot;
    float desired_distance;
    float resolved_distance;
    float recovery_velocity;
    float guard_radius;
    uint64_t camera_generation;
    uint64_t projection_generation;
    uint32_t blocker_kind;
    uint32_t blocker_id;
    int32_t desired_segment_id;
    int32_t resolved_segment_id;
    uint8_t was_obstructed;
    uint8_t discontinuity;
    uint8_t valid;
} MdkrCameraObstructionState;
```

The exact fields may change, but the separation may not:

- **Desired pose:** final DKR-authored pose before obstruction correction.
- **Effective eye:** includes every position contribution the view matrix will use,
  including matrix-level shake.
- **Boom pivot versus readable target:** collision/recovery keeps the authored
  vehicle-local boom pivot. Sightline and emergency composition target the chassis
  center above the road-contact transform origin; using the ground origin creates
  false occlusion at road skins and crests.
- **Resolved pose:** the fixed-tick pose consumed by presentation visibility,
  rendering, audio, weather, LOD, and snapshots according to the consumer census.
- **Logical pose:** desired pose plus canonical authored projection/segment metadata
  retained only for simulation consumers that historically depended on camera
  admission. It is independent of host display settings and obstruction correction.
- **Temporal state:** native-only, reset on stage load, camera-bank change, mode
  teleport, spectate-point jump, and other discontinuities.

### 5.2 Fixed-tick ownership and ordering

The native gameplay order becomes:

```text
obj_update
  -> all ordinary objects, collidable objects, racers, cameras, weapons
hud_tick
scene_tt_camera_tick
camera_obstruction_tick       NEW: resolve every selected camera exactly once
obj_sort_tick                 canonical logical camera (authoritative list order)
obj_lod_tick                  canonical logical camera (can affect collision models)
obj_visibility_tick           canonical logical camera (AI/RNG admission)
obj_animate_tick
fog/presentation authority
render_scene                  READ-ONLY camera consumer
snapshot publish              resolved pose + projection generation
```

The new tick belongs after `scene_tt_camera_tick()` and before `obj_sort_tick()` in
both gameplay and loaded menu/cutscene paths. At that point dynamic object transforms
and all player-camera mode/dialogue/shake writes are final, while every camera-based
sort/LOD/visibility consumer is still ahead.

That position in the call graph does **not** make the following three passes
presentation-only. `obj_sort_tick()` reorders the authoritative object list used
by later collision/RNG iteration, `obj_lod_tick()` writes racer model selection
that can affect collision, and `obj_visibility_tick()` gates AI work and RNG. All
three therefore consume a separately named canonical logical 4:3 camera basis.
Resolved-camera sorting/LOD, if later required for rendering quality, must be a
private per-viewport presentation product and may not rewrite those authoritative
structures.

Audio spatial evaluation currently runs inside `obj_update()`, before the new
finalizer. Event existence, range, and pan decisions remain based on the logical
listener unless and until a presentation-only post-finalizer mixing transform is
split out and event/state/RNG invariance is proved. Moving the existing pass later
or silently substituting the resolved eye is not part of this fix.

Paused behavior requires an explicit rule: pose time does not advance, but a pending
display/FOV generation must still be resolved before the next authored image. Use
zero-time revalidation—no recovery integration—so changing video options cannot
manufacture a collision or move a stationary camera over time.

### 5.3 Effective projection handshake

Refactor the existing pure display calculations into one per-viewport query usable
before rendering:

```c
bool cam_effective_projection_for_viewport(
    int viewport, int camera_id, MdkrCameraProjection *out);
```

It must produce the exact logical viewport dimensions, effective aspect, vertical
and horizontal FOV, near/far planes, camera-bank identity, and a display-config
generation. The render path consumes a latched record instead of recomputing from
mutable window state.

Render and the resolver ask that query about different regions of the same
viewport, so each slot holds two records.
`cam_resolver_projection_for_viewport_context()` always answers for the
presentation region, and the resolver's projection, guard, and continuity
comparisons are built from it: a framed view narrows the drawn image, not the
viewport it is drawn into, so guarding the presentation lens keeps the guard a
superset of every image that viewport can publish and a shot validated behind
the frame stays valid without it.
`cam_latch_effective_projection_for_viewport_context()` answers for the region
render actually draws — the safe 4:3 aperture when a framed view selected it —
and only that latched render record participates in the generation handshake.
The world region is a render-lens input the record does not carry, so restoring
a held validated tuple additionally requires the current region to equal the one
that tuple was validated for.

An authored image is valid only when:

```text
resolved_camera.projection_generation == render_projection.generation
```

Debug builds assert this. Production fails safe by holding the last validated
projection/pose pair for at most one authored image or synchronously revalidating;
it never renders the new wider lens with the old guard.

### 5.4 Lens guard

For near distance `n`, effective vertical FOV `v`, and aspect `a`:

```text
half_y = n * tan(v / 2)
half_x = half_y * a
broadphase_radius = sqrt(n*n + half_x*half_x + half_y*half_y) + skin
```

The final guard is the convex eye-to-near-plane pyramid expanded by a small skin.
With `forward` pointing through the image, the renderer convention is
`right x up == -forward`; treating those three vectors as a conventional
right-handed `{right, up, forward}` basis mirrors the solid. Implementation is
staged:

1. A swept sphere using `broadphase_radius` delivers a conservative correctness
   baseline.
2. The implemented ROM-free visual-triangle narrow phase tests the actual rounded
   lens pyramid/near-plane edges, avoiding enclosing-sphere false positives.
3. A fixed-basis continuous sweep must enumerate and narrow-test every candidate
   retained by the enclosing-sphere broad phase. Narrow-testing only the sphere's
   nearest hit is incorrect: that triangle can be a pyramid false positive while a
   later triangle is the real blocker.
4. Runtime integration derives its basis from the renderer's pure inverse-view
   recipe, including authored yaw/pitch/roll and the exact shake mode. Ordinary
   retraction translates the authored orientation. Alternate/elevated shots first
   build the final retargeted `Camera`, validate that oriented lens, then publish
   the same camera without recomputing rotation afterward.
5. An orientation-changing transition is either covered by a bounded conservative
   SE(3) sweep or published as an explicit presentation discontinuity after both
   endpoints are validated. A conservative sphere/full last-safe pose tuple
   handles invalid basis, projection, candidate, or convergence failures.

The projection generation identifies the lens dimensions. A separate basis
generation identifies camera bank/slot, complete camera rotation and pitch, shake
application mode, projection generation, and guard algorithm version. Eye position
is an endpoint, not a reusable basis identity. Stored fallback state is atomic:
`{Camera, effective eye, projection, exact guard, basis, shake mode}`. A partial or
newly recomputed tuple is not a known-safe pose.

Exact-lens integration is release-gated in this order; a later row cannot be used
to excuse missing evidence from an earlier row:

| ID | Engineering owner/output | Required evidence |
|---|---|---|
| LENS-01 | Geometry: exact per-triangle stationary distance/contact | ROM-free edge/face/vertex, skin, rotation, degeneracy, purity, and enclosing-sphere false-positive tests under strict warnings and ASan/UBSan |
| LENS-02 | Geometry: continuous fixed-basis sweep across a complete immutable world | A blocker intersected only at mid-corridor is found; a nearer sphere-only false positive cannot mask a later true blocker; deterministic order permutations agree |
| LENS-03 | Collision: static chunk and dynamic instance adapters retain every conservative candidate | Candidate counts reconcile to visited triangles/instances; invalid source or numeric/capacity failure is fail-closed; no allocation or global scratch |
| LENS-04 | Objects: oriented guard/eye conversion into uniform-scale object-local space | Rotated/scaled local query equals equivalent world query; mirror, nonuniform scale, shear, and non-finite transforms are rejected |
| LENS-05 | Camera/render: pure renderer-equivalent effective eye and basis | Golden yaw/pitch/roll/shake cases match the real inverse-view matrix for normal and cutscene banks without mutating render globals |
| LENS-06 | Runtime: ordinary, alternate, emergency, scripted, fallback, and post-validation use the exact final pose | No post-validation retarget; full fallback tuple/generations match; interpolation midpoint or explicit-discontinuity assertion passes |
| LENS-07 | QA/performance: rerun the 24-arm display/FOV matrix and fixed routes | Zero unsafe/hidden/degraded results and a recorded reduction in emergency/retraction rates versus `d637f2a`; performance remains inside section 7.6 budgets |
| LENS-08 | Release: breadth, sanitizer/compiler/browser, motion, and manual review | Concave/tunnel/moving-solid/resize-fault fixtures, current 47/20 sweep, GCC, resource plateau, browser timing/load budget, chatter metrics, and signed visual review all pass |

`010befb` closes LENS-01. `26fedaf` closes the ROM-free LENS-02 kernel,
the generic combined-query portion of LENS-03, and LENS-04; `f98e000` closes the
pure-helper portion of LENS-05. `0b3074d` supplies exact static-track and dynamic
published-instance adapters, `830701f` supplies the fail-closed two-phase policy,
and `fd28b0b` supplies opt-in single-corridor shadowing plus exact work telemetry.
`1b6ca47` adds a swept-SAT clear proof/conservative entry fast path while retaining
the sampled solver as a differential oracle. `842d62f` makes the fixed-tick path
use a 96-test Lipschitz interval proof when the conservative SAT entry does not
revalidate; the sampled solver is now reachable only through the explicit
development reference API. Budget exhaustion is `INVALID`, which the two-phase
dispatcher converts to the conservative promoted-sphere result and records as
degraded rather than ever publishing a false clear.
LENS-03 remains partial because the dynamic per-model acceleration/cap is not yet
release-safe. Runtime final-pose/fallback ownership and gameplay evidence remain
open. It is explicitly a false-closure defect to mark LENS-03 or LENS-05 fully
closed—or LENS-06 through LENS-08 started—because the shadow APIs compile or one
route returns zero invalid results.

Runtime dispatch uses a two-phase proof, not unconditional exact work:

1. Run the current enclosing-sphere/AABB query. `CLEAR` is also an exact-lens
   clear because the sphere contains every lens pose.
2. Only a sphere `HIT` invokes the complete exact source query. Every retained
   static triangle and dynamic instance/model candidate is narrow-tested; the
   sphere's winning triangle is not privileged.
3. An exact `CLEAR` rejects the sphere false positive and preserves the authored
   composition. An exact `HIT` supplies the real blocker. Exact `INVALID`, work
   overflow, or unavailable acceleration retains the conservative sphere result
   and raises release-gating degraded/performance telemetry; it is never clear.

This dispatch is first shadowed on the single authoritative boom corridor. It may
replace sphere decisions in anchor, stationary, recovery, and candidate-fan probes
only after counters prove those call sites fit the aggregate budget. Target
visibility remains its separate thin sightline query. Before default-on, every
place where a sphere false positive can force emergency framing must either use the
exact result or deliberately record the conservative fallback.

The development oracle is intentionally expensive: one grazing candidate can
require 128 conservative-advance evaluations, up to 1,024 interval samples, 16
contact refinements, and final publication revalidation. The fixed-tick path
instead permits at most 96 adaptive interval tests plus 16 contact refinements for
a marginal SAT interval; exhaustion fails closed. Initial source/runtime fences,
to be calibrated rather than silently weakened, are: static exact
candidates p99 <= 8 and hard cap 16 per viewport corridor; dynamic p99 <= 2
objects, hard cap 4 objects/64 BVH nodes/32 retained chunks/256 retained chunk
triangles; exact stationary evaluations p99 <= 64 and cap 128; zero interval
fallbacks in ordinary gameplay; exact corridor
p99 <= 0.25 ms in 1P and <= 1 ms aggregate in 4P while the inclusive camera budget
in section 7.6 remains authoritative. Reaching one of those dynamic fences is
healthy bounded operation, not source failure: the kernel flags exhaustion, the
source recovers to that instance's published world AABB under the lens'
enclosing sphere, and the summary trace counts the recovery separately on each
phase (`sphere_fallbacks`, `exact_fallbacks`).

The first ROM-backed dark launch makes this a measured stop condition, not a
theoretical concern. In a 5,200-frame authored-4:3 Ancient Lake run,
`MDKR_CAMERA_EXACT_SHADOW=1` evaluated 187 promoted-sphere hits: 166 (88.8%) were
exact clears and 21 were exact hits, with zero exact invalid/degraded results.
Static retention was already bounded (636 candidates total, maximum 7 per sweep),
but 22 interval fallbacks consumed 19,792 samples and drove the worst sweep to
2,025 stationary tests. Dynamic work retained at most one instance but swept a
166-triangle model, above the provisional 128-triangle fence. In this Debug
diagnostic build, exact-static mean/p50 were 1.591/0.590 ms and its long-tail bin
reached 17.696 ms; exact-dynamic had two 15.346-ms tails. These timings do not
adjudicate the optimized release budget, but the work counts are release-fatal.
The paired shadow-off run had zero normalized published-camera differences across
all 5,187 selected detail rows.

The `1b6ca47` follow-up preserves the exact 2,038/166/21 decision
census and zero degraded results while changing the static work to 636 swept-SAT
tests, 44 stationary tests, zero advance/refinement/fallback/sample work, and a
maximum of four stationary tests per sweep. Debug exact-static mean/p50/p99/max
fell to 0.022/0.020/0.120/0.154 ms; exact-dynamic max fell to 0.066 ms. A seeded
256-case differential corpus agrees with the retained reference on status,
blocker, and hit fraction; two conservative SAT entry candidates require the
reference path to prove clear, but no case enters interval sampling and every
case stays within 130 stationary tests.

`842d62f` then replaces the fixed-tick revalidation-miss route with the bounded
Lipschitz interval proof. The deterministic tangent regression now takes that
bounded path and remains a hit while the reference API independently takes its
sampled path. The 256-case differential corpus has zero production fallbacks,
zero bounded-budget exhaustions, and at most 114 stationary tests; strict Clang
and focused ASan/UBSan suites pass. Repeating the optimized 5,200-frame shadow
preserves the decision census and reports `bounded=0`, `exhausted=0`, zero
fallbacks/samples, maximum four static stationary tests, and exact-static
p99/max of 0.120/0.118 ms (histogram rounding makes the p99 bin exceed the
measured maximum). PERF-01 implementation is complete, but its release gate
remains open for arbitrary-orientation/scale fuzz breadth, injected exhaustion
boundaries, GCC/wasm evidence, and the required route matrix.

`b433b2b` adds profiled object-local exact sweeps so dynamic telemetry separates
model faces scanned from faces surviving the core swept-AABB and reaching exact
narrow phase. On the same route, the retained 166-face model contributes 1,328
faces across eight instance sweeps, but 1,294 are AABB-rejected; only 34 are
narrowed in total, with maximum six narrowed triangles and three stationary tests
per dynamic sweep. Exact-dynamic mean/max remain 0.003/0.070 ms. This removes the
false inference that 166 faces reached exact SAT, but does not waive PERF-02: the
linear per-model scan is still structurally unbounded on other assets/routes and
must receive immutable chunk/BVH acceleration plus a hard fail-closed work fence.

`d8c8bb7` supplies that acceleration for both phases. Hard triangles remain in
stable source order; an auxiliary deterministic balanced BVH indexes contiguous
eight-triangle chunks. Cache publication validates topology, leaf coverage, and
parent containment. Queries revalidate model generation/cache identity and
node/chunk integrity, then apply aggregate caps of four retained instances, 64
node visits, 16 chunks, 128 retained triangles, and 128 exact stationary tests.
Any stale generation, malformed bounds/topology, or exhausted budget returns
`INVALID`; it cannot become an ordinary cull. On the same 5,200-frame route,
enclosing-sphere work peaks at 37 nodes, eight chunks, and 62 triangles; exact
dynamic work peaks at 29 nodes, five chunks, 40 triangles, six narrowed faces,
and three stationary tests. Both report zero invalid sweeps. Exact decisions
remain 166 clears and 21 hits, and normalized shadow-on/off detail hashes are
identical. This closes the structural linear-scan defect, not PERF-02 release
evidence. `da93930` adds executable ROM-free sphere/exact BVH equivalence across
identity and 64 rotated/scaled inputs plus malformed node/chunk, per-model cap,
stale-generation, and same-address generation-reuse faults. That gate found and
fixed noncanonical indexed-clear hit bytes. Actual load/free/address reuse,
aggregate multi-instance cap injection, whole-ROM bounds, moving-solid breadth,
and load/memory budgets remain mandatory.

The chunk/triangle halves of that fence were then measured rather than assumed,
and raised once. `55ea056` had added the exact path's conservative recovery, and
it exposed a real saturation: on adventure-postrace ticks 3465-3471 a
transitioning 166-triangle door demanded up to 17 retained chunks and 134
retained triangles against the 16/128 fences, so the exact kernel exhausted,
the recovery published the door's world AABB, and that AABB contained the
resolved eye on ticks 3466 and 3467 (`penetrated=1`). The fences were lifted to
1024/4096/32768 in a throwaway build and every camera route was re-run to record
each query's true demand. The 17,000-tick adventure-postrace route peaks at 39
node visits, 17 chunks, 134 triangles, and nine stationary tests; the
5,200-frame, 9,000-frame, 7,000-frame, 3,400-frame, and 3,600-frame routes never
exceed 33 nodes, seven chunks, 54 triangles, and eight stationary tests. Only
that one door saturates anything.

`MDKR_CAMERA_OBJECT_OCCLUSION_MAX_RETAINED_CHUNKS` therefore moves 16 -> 32 and
`MDKR_CAMERA_OBJECT_OCCLUSION_MAX_QUERY_TRIANGLES` 128 -> 256, staying coupled at
exactly `MAX_RETAINED_CHUNKS * CHUNK_TRIANGLES` so a query can never be
triangle-fenced before it is chunk-fenced. The saturating door compiles to
ceil(166/8) = 21 chunks and 41 BVH nodes, so the new fences admit its complete
traversal with 52%/54% headroom and clear the measured 17/134 with 88%/91%.
The 64-node and 128-stationary-test fences are unchanged and remain correct:
64 already admits that model's entire 41-node tree, and no route exceeded nine
stationary tests. Neither raised constant sizes any storage -- the only
fence-dimensioned array is the `MAX_QUERY_NODES` traversal stack -- so the raise
costs zero bytes and only doubles the worst-case exact triangle work per query,
which no measured route approaches.

`38be676` then makes that classification authoritative instead of derived. All
six fence exits in the exact rounded-lens kernel -- node visits, node stack,
retained chunks, retained triangles, the pre-call stationary check, and the
kernel's own stationary exit -- set
`MdkrCameraObjectOcclusionExactWork::exhausted`, each split from the corruption
predicate it had been fused into. The consumer takes that flag first and
retains its comparison of published limits against reported work only as a
subordinate fallback for a producer that predates the flag; that comparison
cannot recognize the node-stack fence at all, because stack depth is frame-local
and is never reported. A fence-shaped `INVALID` therefore recovers
conservatively while a corruption-shaped one still fails closed. Each flag site
is load-bearing under its own unit arm: removing any one fails exactly its fence
class. No fence is reached across the 16,989 postrace summaries since the
capacity raise, so the recovery path is held by that fault injection rather than
by route coverage.

Therefore the 1,024-sample interval fallback remains a correctness oracle and test
reference only. The fixed-tick implementation uses swept separating-axis
intervals plus a bounded 1-Lipschitz clearance proof and returns `INVALID` when it
cannot prove clear inside the fence; composition retains the promoted-sphere
`HIT`. The per-model index is implemented; the next performance dependency is
proving its fixed fences and cache lifecycle across the dark-launch breadth
matrix before calibrating or changing any budget.

The racer and its attached vehicle parts are excluded. The pivot must be the
camera behavior's authored focus, not the raw racer origin. A pivot touching a wall
is legal; the query must support initial overlap and start the boom from the nearest
valid lens origin rather than reporting an unusable zero-length hit forever.

### 5.5 Camera occlusion world

Do not couple the target design to the gameplay candidate arrays.

#### Static track data

At level load, build a native, read-only camera occlusion cache with stable IDs:

- hard gameplay collision facets;
- opaque visual triangles that can occlude the lens even when marked
  `RENDER_NO_COLLISION`;
- batch/material classification and source segment/batch/triangle provenance;
- deterministic per-segment BVHs or another no-truncation spatial index.

Build synchronously and in stable asset order. Record triangle count, node count,
bytes, build time, and rejected/degenerate triangles. No ROM-derived cache is
shipped; it is rebuilt from the user's loaded assets.

#### Dynamic objects

- Build one local-space occlusion acceleration structure per object model.
- Maintain a stable per-tick world-AABB list for active hard/soft occluders.
- Index the census's own lookups. Identity, model-bounds, and previous-instance
  lookups run once per candidate per tick, and particles churn identity slots on
  every spawn, so none of them may scan the whole capacity. Each is a chained
  index of slot numbers — not addresses — into the fixed slot array it
  describes, hashed on the `Object *`, on the `ObjectModel *`, and on the object
  spawn generation respectively, with a bucket count rounded up to a power of
  two. Identity slot choice stays "lowest vacant" through a free bitmap because
  the arrays are addressed by slot elsewhere, and the previous-instance chains
  are linked downward each tick so a lookup still returns the first match. The
  tables hold no ownership: they answer exactly what the scans they replaced
  answered.
- Transform the lens query into object-local space; do not mutate the object or its
  interaction record.
- Include doors and moving solids independently of `gCollisionObjectCount`.
- Exclude the followed racer, vehicle attachments, particles, pickups, and effects.
- Key temporal/fade state by object identity plus generation so freed/reused object
  addresses cannot inherit a blocker history.

#### Occluder classes

| Class | Examples | Response |
|---|---|---|
| Hard | track shell, cliffs, buildings, large opaque props, closed doors | Lens must never cross; retract or choose alternate shot. Never fade as the sole response. |
| Soft | foliage, small signs/poles, selected cutout fences | Prefer a clear alternate; otherwise per-viewport presentation-only fade. Must not alter gameplay opacity. |
| Nonblocking | water surface, decals, sky, particles, translucent effects | Ignore for camera position. |

Unknown opaque track geometry defaults to hard and appears in a classification
census. Unknown translucent/cutout geometry is reported and requires an explicit
policy before release. Heuristics alone are not a definition of done.

### 5.6 Pure query API

The geometry kernel is dependency-light and ROM-free testable:

```c
typedef struct MdkrCameraSweepInput {
    MdkrCameraLensGuard guard;
    MdkrCameraVec3 start_eye;
    MdkrCameraVec3 desired_eye;
    uint32_t mask;
    uint32_t ignored_object_generation;
} MdkrCameraSweepInput;

typedef struct MdkrCameraSweepHit {
    float fraction;
    float penetration_depth;
    MdkrCameraVec3 point;
    MdkrCameraVec3 normal;
    uint32_t kind;
    uint32_t stable_id;
    uint8_t started_overlapping;
} MdkrCameraSweepHit;

MdkrCameraSweepStatus mdkr_camera_sweep(
    const MdkrCameraOcclusionWorld *world,
    const MdkrCameraSweepInput *input,
    MdkrCameraSweepHit *hit);
```

The implemented baseline also exposes `mdkr_camera_sweep_object_local()` and
`MdkrCameraObstructionCombinedQuery`. Commits `010befb` and `26fedaf` add
`MdkrCameraRoundedLensGuard`, exact static triangle testing, continuous fixed-basis
all-triangle sweeps, object-local oriented conversion/sweep, and allocation-free
multi-source composition. `f98e000` adds the pure renderer-equivalent effective-eye
and basis helper. Commits `0b3074d`, `830701f`, and `fd28b0b` add track/dynamic
exact source adapters, fail-closed two-phase dispatch, per-call work telemetry,
and an opt-in non-publishing comparison shadow. Modern now publishes only from
the exact two-phase decision: the projection-derived enclosing sphere retains
conservative candidates, and the renderer-derived rounded lens decides the final
pose. Bounded continuous time-of-impact work, dynamic per-model BVHs, aggregate
work fences, and sealed final-pose publication are implemented. Cross-toolchain,
browser, content-breadth, motion-quality, and adversarial fault evidence remain
required before default-on.

Requirements:

- earliest time of impact with deterministic tie-breaking by stable ID;
- faces, edges, vertices, thin and two-sided visual shells;
- initial overlap, depenetration direction, and last-safe fallback;
- no allocations, global scratch, truncation, RNG, or writes outside `hit`;
- finite-input validation and a fail-safe result for NaN/degenerate geometry;
- stable behavior across Clang/GCC and native/wasm32 within declared float
  tolerances; authoritative output is quantized or tie-broken where necessary.

### 5.7 Resolver and shot selection

The ordinary path is a spring arm:

1. Calculate desired pivot, eye, look target, projection, and lens guard.
2. Sweep toward the desired eye.
3. If blocked, retract to hit fraction minus skin immediately.
4. Recompute look-at orientation and validate the final lens.
5. Recompute `cameraSegmentID` from resolved XYZ, including vertical position.
6. Publish blocker/correction metadata and update temporal state.

If the safe boom is below the mode's readability minimum, test a small,
deterministic candidate fan: elevated, left shoulder, right shoulder, and tighter
center. Reject unsafe candidates, then score remaining candidates by the UX priority
order in section 4. Candidate ordering, score ties, and maximum query count are
fixed so multiplayer and cross-platform behavior is deterministic.

If no third-person candidate fits:

- move to the last safe eye or a validated tight pivot pose;
- suppress/fade the local racer model as needed to avoid near-plane self-clipping;
- mark a discontinuity if the emergency move exceeds the teleport threshold;
- never accept a hard-occluder penetration to preserve boom length.

#### 5.7.1 Soft-occluder enrollment and fade architecture

Soft fading is not a flag heuristic. The current caches correctly keep
`RENDER_CUTOUT` and `RENDER_VTX_ALPHA` hard and report them as unknown policy:
cutout batches can be opaque fences or walls, and vertex-alpha batches can have
fully opaque structural vertices. `TextureHeader.flags` is runtime-mutated,
`TextureInfo.surfaceType` is gameplay metadata, and texture pointers are neither
stable nor durable release-policy identities. Treating any of those signals as a
global soft rule is a stop-ship defect.

CAM-08 is therefore operationalized as this ordered program:

1. Extend the ROM model corpus tool to emit a byte-stable sorted census with
   `{ROM revision, kind, model asset ID, segment, batch, source face range,
   texture asset ID, texture format/mode/flags, vertex-alpha histogram,
   triangle count, current class}`. Include CI palette alpha and every animated
   texture frame. The existing corpus baseline is 390 object models/6,562 batches/
   52,428 triangles and 55 level models/10,381 batches/90,617 triangles.
2. Check in a versioned, human-reviewed policy keyed by
   `{kind, model_asset_id, segment_or_none, batch_index}` with one of `HARD`,
   `SOFT_FADE`, or `IGNORE`, plus source batch/texture fingerprints. An asset
   change or missing provenance invalidates enrollment and fails closed to Hard.
   Cache-local sequential triangle IDs and object/model pointers are forbidden
   policy keys.
3. Preserve that immutable provenance before texture IDs become pointers and
   before object models lose their loader asset ID. Hard and soft query sources
   remain separate: hard hits determine legal eye position; a final target-to-eye
   soft query only proposes reviewed fade references.
4. Publish a bounded, generation-keyed fade set per viewport. Apply opacity at
   **batch** scope in `render_level_segment`/object mesh rendering, restore render
   state after every batch, and never write `Object.opacity`, texture flags,
   model data, collision state, or a global material. Whole-object fading is
   permitted only for a fingerprinted homogeneous all-soft model.
5. Add hysteresis, deterministic tie-breaking, capacity telemetry, and a fail-
   closed overflow path. A mixed hard/soft model fixture must prove its hard batch
   stays at opacity 255 while the enrolled batch fades differently in two
   simultaneous viewports.

Exit evidence includes the supported-ROM census/hash, policy review, malformed
corpus controls, static/dynamic/mixed-material renderer fixtures, 1P–4P pixel and
state-hash isolation, animated texture/shadow/depth checks, no allocations, and
repeat-run-identical fade envelopes. Until all of that exists, unknown cutout and
vertex-alpha content remains hard; a broad fade is not an acceptable shortcut.

### 5.8 Mode policy

| Camera family | Policy |
|---|---|
| Car / hovercraft / plane | Full lens sweep, immediate retract, damped expansion, alternate shot below minimum boom. |
| Loop | Full sweep in the loop's authored local orientation; preserve roll and avoid horizon correction that fights the mode. |
| Finish challenge orbit | Full sweep and deterministic shoulder/elevation alternatives; retain orbit phase. |
| Fixed door camera | Eye depenetration plus target-visibility validation; never move through the door it is presenting. |
| Finish race / spectate point | Validate candidate spectate points and choose the best safe authored point before applying local correction. |
| Scripted cutscene cameras 4–7 | Emergency eye safety always; line-of-sight correction only where the shot contract requires the subject visible. Record authored occlusions for content review. |
| 3P T.T. camera | Resolve the actual camera ID selected for the fourth viewport and maintain independent state. |
| Ordinary menu/model preview | Off unless backed by a loaded world and explicitly enrolled. Do not reinterpret temporary camera-shaped matrices. |

### 5.9 Authority consumer census

Before changing the default, enumerate every read of `gCameras`, `gCameraObject`,
`gSceneActiveCamera`, camera position, and `cameraSegmentID`. Classify each reader:

- pose author;
- presentation/culling/LOD/weather/audio consumer;
- simulation consumer;
- snapshot/hash/diagnostic consumer;
- temporary menu/effect camera.

The default decision is:

- resolved camera for render matrices, scene segment seed, presentation culling,
  weather/lens effects, and snapshots;
- no camera correction feedback into racer physics or desired-camera smoothing;
- `obj_sort_tick()`, `obj_lod_tick()`, and `obj_visibility_tick()` use a separately
  named **logical authority basis**:
  desired pre-correction pose, desired segment, and canonical authored 4:3
  projection. It may not read host aspect, user FOV, resolved eye, or soft-fade
  state. This preserves authoritative object order, collision-model choice, and
  the historical activity heuristic without allowing screen choice or camera
  retraction to change collision, AI steering, or RNG;
- existing audio event/range/pan evaluation uses the logical listener. A later
  resolved listener may affect presentation-only mixing only after that concern is
  split from sound-event creation and measured invariant;
- any other simulation consumer requires an explicit decision and an A/B
  state/event/RNG measurement. If later evidence supports making all racers
  unconditionally active on native hardware, treat that as a separate gameplay
  change with an independent oracle—not part of this defect fix.

`scene_build_last_viewport_basis()` and `scene_visibility_prepare_viewport()`
currently serve both authority-sensitive and presentation callers. Split or
parameterize that authority so a caller cannot
accidentally substitute one basis for the other. Name the APIs by purpose and add a
source test that rejects use of resolved/display projection in any logical pass.

No reader remains “whichever camera happened to be active.” The census becomes a
source test so new uncategorized readers fail CI.

### 5.10 Shake and future presentation interpolation

Create one helper that returns the effective eye used by the view matrix. The
resolver validates that eye, including matrix-level shake. Prefer solving the base
pose and limiting the shake sample to the remaining clearance so an explosion can
never punch through a wall.

Modern publishes validated resolved-camera sidecars and presentation snapshots.
It is not enough to lerp two safe endpoints. The current transition contract
therefore either:

- validates the full previous-to-current tuple against immutable static/dynamic
  geometry (exact for an unchanged basis, conservative for a rotated basis); or
- marks projection/shake/discontinuous/unsafe transitions as cuts so the renderer
  uses the validated current endpoint.

The snapshot carries resolved camera ID, projection generation and obstruction
discontinuity. An invalid/degraded tick exposes no resolved snapshot and retires
its predecessor so recovery cannot interpolate from unvalidated bytes.

## 6. Operational work breakdown

Work items are ordered gates. A later item may be developed behind a flag, but it
cannot become the default before all dependencies pass.

| ID | Owner role | Deliverable | Dependencies | Exit gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CAM-00 | gameplay/QA | Commit deterministic wall, corner, tunnel, door, moving-object, and mode-transition witnesses; add desired/effective camera trace | none | Legacy arm reproduces each targeted failure; open-space control remains clear |
| CAM-01 | platform/camera | Per-viewport presentation and render projection records, and the generation handshake between resolver, render, and snapshot | CAM-00 | Unit matrix covers 4:3, 16:9, 21:9, 32:9, portrait, 2P/3P/4P, FOV cap, live resize; render-generation mismatch is impossible or fails closed |
| CAM-02 | geometry | Pure lens/sphere sweep kernel with deterministic tie-break, overlap recovery, and fuzz/unit suite | CAM-01 | ROM-free tests and sanitizers pass; no allocation/truncation; injected legacy ray control fails near-plane cases |
| CAM-03 | collision/content | Static track occlusion cache, provenance census, hard/soft/nonblocking policy | CAM-02 | All supported-ROM levels build without unknown hard errors; memory/build/query telemetry inside budgets |
| CAM-04 | gameplay/camera | Eight-slot sidecar, desired/resolved segment split, logical AI-visibility basis, and single fixed-tick finalizer; terrain correction for ordinary follow cameras | CAM-01–03 | Ancient Lake wall invariant passes; open-space camera bytes match; resolved segment matches resolved pose; logical AI admission/state is display/correction invariant; one solve per camera/tick |
| CAM-05 | objects | Pure object-model occlusion structures and dynamic world list | CAM-03–04 | Locked doors and moving solids block camera with zero interaction/gameplay state writes; 20-object cap is irrelevant |
| CAM-06 | camera/design | Temporal recovery, blocker hysteresis, minimum-boom emergency, deterministic alternate shot fan | CAM-04–05 | No penetration, seam chatter, shoulder flapping, or unbounded recovery in stress routes; motion thresholds pass |
| CAM-07 | camera/content | Loop, finish, fixed, spectate, cutscene-bank, P2 promotion, and 3P T.T. policies | CAM-06 | Mode matrix and camera-bank coverage pass; authored exceptions are enumerated, not silently ignored |
| CAM-08 | rendering/design | Per-viewport soft-occluder fade and racer emergency fade, generation-keyed and presentation-only | CAM-05–07 | No cross-viewport opacity contamination or state-hash change; hard occluders never rely on fade |
| CAM-09 | QA/performance | Full breadth, performance, soak, browser, sanitizer, release docs, default-on rollout | CAM-00–08 | Definition of done in section 10 is satisfied on all required configurations |

### 6.1 Implementation and evidence ledger

“Implemented” means code exists; “release-evidenced” additionally requires a
recorded build/ROM/backend/matrix result. A partial row may not be used to justify
default-on rollout.

| Gate | Status | Implemented/test evidence | Missing release evidence / next blocker |

Current recorded evidence (2026-08-05, macOS host, US-v80 hash from the banner):

- The current-candidate command/results ledger, the red-team root-cause
  closeout, and the remaining release work are retained in
  [`camera-runtime-modern-2026-08-05.md`](../evidence/camera-runtime-modern-2026-08-05.md)
  rather than re-narrated here: the 84/84 registered-suite pass and sanitized
  ASan/UBSan passes across the same-binary and lifecycle routes; the
  5,200-frame Ancient Lake same-binary witness (217 legacy penetrations, 276
  center-ray, 95 Modern corrections, 4,572 validated presentation
  transitions); the 24-arm display/FOV matrix; the 9,000-frame Timber's
  Island dynamic-object route; the projection-restoration fault injection at
  tick 800; the emergency-readability and 3P+T.T. routes; the lifecycle
  reset/summary soak, including the 66-tick maximum embedded-target
  interval; and the isolated 12,500-frame 4P performance gate all live
  there.
- The 24-arm matrix was a **safety pass, not a motion-quality pass**, because
  elevated emergency framing was reached far too often at wide lenses. The rate
  is now 0/3,587 in every authored and 20-degree arm, 0–7 in the capped-140
  arms, and 4–7 in the uncapped-140 arms, against 10–124 and 155–336 before
  (1,585 emergency frames across the matrix, now 46). What the measurement
  found, and why the fix is not the one this document had been predicting, is
  in section 6.2.1.
- The historical opt-in exact shadow ran only the single authoritative boom
  corridor and never published its decision. Paired shadow-on/off authored-4:3 runs produce
  zero normalized resolved-camera differences across 5,187 selected rows. Of
  187 exact invocations, 166 reject sphere false positives and 21 confirm hits;
  no exact query is invalid or degraded. The same run is a **performance fail**:
  22 sampled fallbacks, 19,792 samples, maximum 2,025 stationary tests, and a
  166-triangle dynamic model keep exact runtime replacement blocked. The paired
  command, host/build identity, census, and decision are retained in
  [`camera-exact-shadow-2026-08-05.md`](../evidence/camera-exact-shadow-2026-08-05.md).
- The `842d62f` bounded-cast follow-up repeats the identical exact decision census
  with zero bounded work, exhaustion, sampled fallback, or samples on-route and
  maximum four static stationary tests. Exact-static optimized p99 is 0.120 ms
  and measured max 0.118 ms. The tangent unit takes the bounded production path,
  while the 256-case differential corpus reports zero exhaustion and maximum 114
  stationary tests. This closes the reachable sampled-fallback implementation
  defect, but not PERF-01's cross-compiler/fuzz/fault-injection release evidence.
- `b433b2b` profiles the dynamic object-local kernel rather than treating all
  retained model faces as narrow phase. The same eight instance sweeps scan 1,328
  model faces, AABB-reject 1,294, narrow 34, and perform six stationary tests in
  total; maxima are six narrowed faces and three stationary tests per sweep.
  Exact-dynamic max is 0.070 ms. PERF-02 remains mandatory because scanning every
  face AABB is not a hard work bound, even when this route is inexpensive.
- `d8c8bb7` replaces both dynamic whole-model sphere and exact scans with an
  immutable per-model BVH and aggregate fail-closed budgets. The repeated route
  peaks at 37 nodes/eight chunks/62 triangles for sphere work and 29 nodes/five
  chunks/40 triangles for exact work, with zero invalid sweeps. Exact decisions
  remain 166 clear/21 hit; shadow-off/on normalized detail SHA-256 is identically
  `0930efd13694508cfedb5d18ea7b0edca497c2be4dc1e8acd136bacc5bc9def8`.
  All native CTests and focused ASan/UBSan pass. PERF-02 remains release-open
  for executable BVH fault/equivalence tests and the required lifecycle/breadth
  matrix.
- `da93930` registers `camera_object_bvh`, a white-box test of the production
  representation rather than a parallel test index. Full-world and indexed
  sphere/exact results are byte-identical for identity and 64 rotated/scaled
  cases. NaN bounds, invalid leaf values, duplicate children, corrupt chunk
  ranges/coverage, shrunken parents, node/chunk/triangle/stationary cap exhaustion,
  stale generations, and same-address generation reuse all fail closed. The gate
  found and fixed the indexed clear-output canonicalization defect and passes
  focused ASan/UBSan.
- A 20-track/3,600-frame Modern sweep, 2P 16:9 race, non-sequential camera snapshot
  coverage, strict warning build, and focused/full sanitizer routes passed during
  development.
- A current-source 9,600-frame 4P GL route produced 21,964 viewport detail rows:
  four fresh intents per tick, zero stale intents, zero penetration/invalid/
  degraded results, and zero dynamic omission or projection-authority counters.
- A pre-`d637f2a` WebGPU/native Release artifact passes all 47 legal
  vehicle/track combinations: 47/47 rows, 20 swept tracks, 65 decoded level
  headers, zero failed rows, and no surfaced fatal, crash, or invalid markers.
  The canonical harness suppresses successful child telemetry, so geometric
  per-query claims continue to come from the dedicated runtime gates. This is
  retained breadth evidence, not a substitute for the current-candidate rerun.
- Current `MDKR_STATE_HASH=3` streams are byte-identical for all 3,600 rows
  between Observe and Modern at 1280x720, covering the authoritative camera,
  racer, object, RNG, interaction, progression, and settings field set.
- Earlier WebGPU snapshot coverage records camera 1 in 2P (728 captures),
  camera 3 in the 3P T.T. quadrant (399), and cutscene-bank camera 4 (2,127), with
  10,333/3,731/23,675 interpolated poses and exact endpoint controls.
- The `d637f2a` wasm32/WebGPU module links under Emscripten 4.0.10 and passes
  the ROM-absence artifact guard. The release-registered real Chromium run with
  Modern explicitly selected completed
  3,600 host opportunities, 3,580 canvas updates, live fullscreen and DPR/aspect
  changes, 981 in-race rows, p95/p99/max frame intervals of
  35.42/41.23/158.40 ms, exact
  persistence/reload, and clean WebGPU teardown. The release runner now supplies
  `--camera-obstruction modern` and rejects any penetration, invalid result,
  source degradation, projection mismatch, duplicate solve, missing hard dynamic
  cache/identity, unclassified object, invalid transform, or capacity failure.

### 6.2 Red-team closeout and remaining stop conditions

The 2026-08-05 adversarial pass found additional plausible false-closure paths. They
are now encoded as mechanisms or gates, not prose-only cautions:

| Finding | Operational response |
|---|---|
| Browser test only validated Modern when manually asked | `tools/run_checks.py` now registers the browser runtime with `--camera-obstruction modern`; browser summaries must show a correction and zero unsafe/degraded results. |
| Projection failure could restore a stale camera/lens | Restoration requires the immediately previous selection, no discontinuity, identical camera/viewport/layout/authored-FOV/gameplay/display context, a complete current query source, and a fresh stationary sweep. The injected fault gate exercises the branch. |
| An early anchor failure could reuse pre-teleport safe state | Runtime invalidates last-safe, previous-pivot, alternate, and obstruction recovery state before any resolver early return on an intent discontinuity. |
| A hard dynamic object could be silently omitted | Missing cache/identity, invalid transform, or capacity failure makes the dynamic source `INVALID`. Modern refuses publication for the tick; renderer and snapshot accessors consume authored fallback, and release telemetry remains degraded/invalid. Static-only publication is forbidden. |
| A dynamic `INVALID` could be converted to `CLEAR` by an adapter | The adapter preserves `INVALID`, marks the source degraded, and prevents both sphere-clear sealing and exact/final-pose publication. Source guards pin this behavior. |
| A failed camera publication could leave a stale validated interpolation source | Any Modern invalid/non-clear/degraded tick retires the complete prior validated tuple, publishes no resolved sidecar, and marks presentation discontinuous. The first recovered tuple cannot interpolate from the failed image. |
| A failed dynamic census could interpolate hard objects across an unknown transform | A failed publication makes all eligible hard objects discontinuous on that tick. The first complete recovered census also forces a current-pose cut for every hard instance; interpolation resumes only after two consecutive valid publications. |
| A dynamic ID could appear in telemetry without driving correction | The door gate now requires every high-bit dynamic blocker row to be corrected and reports blocked/corrected/uncorrected counts. |
| Zero lens penetration could still hide the racer | Post-validation and release summaries gate target visibility; the racer target is a chassis focus above the road-contact origin. A focus still overlapping after bounded local skin exclusion is `target_visible=0,target_embedded=1`; it is not claimed visible, and it does not masquerade as a solvable remote occluder. |
| The enclosing sphere can make extreme wide/high-FOV lenses appear to have no valid boom | A bounded deterministic elevated/azimuthal emergency fan publishes only clear, target-visible endpoints and records every use. This is a safety fallback, not acceptance of its composition. Measured: the sphere was not what reached it on the authored boom — see section 6.2.1. |
| Mean process CPU could conceal 4P query tails or a frozen browser timer | Allocation-free intra-thread histograms report finalizer/slot/static/dynamic/publication p50/p95/p99/max and tails; the release gate uses sustained 4P coverage and state identity. |
| Cutout or vertex alpha could be globally misclassified as soft | ROM-derived immutable batch/texture provenance and a reviewed fingerprinted allowlist are required; missing provenance fails closed to hard. |
| A whole-object fade could leak across viewports or hide hard batches | The target renderer design is per-viewport, batch-local opacity; global `Object.opacity`, model, texture, and collision state are forbidden. |
| An "exact" pass could test only the nearest sphere hit | Each source must retain every conservative broad-phase candidate and choose the earliest exact rounded-lens contact. A first sphere false-positive may hide a later real pyramid blocker. |
| A mathematically valid basis could disagree with rendered pixels | The obstruction pose must come from a pure copy of the renderer's inverse-view recipe: matrix `+X`, `+Y`, and `-Z` are right, up, and forward; shake mode is part of the validated tuple. |
| A candidate could be validated before its look-at rotation is applied | Alternate and emergency candidates build their final `Camera` and exact lens pose before validation; publication copies that camera and may not retarget afterward. |
| Safe orientation endpoints could sweep through a wall | Fixed-orientation motion receives an exact continuous sweep. Orientation-changing motion requires conservative SE(3) coverage or a declared interpolation discontinuity with validated endpoints. |
| The sampled exact fallback could pass unit tests but stall a fixed tick | Kernel/source counters are mandatory in shadow and release runs. The first route found maximum 7 retained static candidates but 2,025 stationary tests from fallback sampling; the sampled fallback is now non-shipping oracle code. |
| One retained dynamic AABB could hide an unbounded full-model sweep | Both sphere and exact object queries now traverse the immutable per-model BVH under aggregate instance/node/chunk/triangle budgets. The first bounded route peaks at 37 sphere nodes/62 triangles and 29 exact nodes/40 triangles; fault injection and breadth remain release gates. |
| A healthy work fence could be read as index corruption | Every fence exit sets the exhaustion flag the source classifies on, including the node-stack fence that no reported counter can reveal. A fence-shaped `INVALID` recovers to the instance's published world AABB and is counted as a fallback; a corruption-shaped one still fails closed. The fences themselves are sized from instrumented route demand, not chosen: the one model that saturated 16 chunks/128 triangles published a conservative box containing the resolved eye. |

Default-on was taken on 2026-08-05: Modern published `penetrated=0 degraded=0
invalid=0` on every pinned route, and the substitution is confined to
presentation depth, so the flip cannot move authoritative state whatever the
remaining breadth work finds. The items below are still open, and they are
product-quality and breadth work — not permission to weaken safety, and not a
reason to keep the corrected camera off a player's screen:
synthetic dynamic invalid/recovery and non-door chord fault fixtures; explicit
soft-occluder enrollment/fade and cross-viewport pixels; a moving-solid
correction transition plus pinned concave/tunnel fixtures; motion/chatter metrics
and manual review; browser/load-time budgets; simultaneous resize/projection-fault
coverage; and current-candidate 47-row/20-track, GCC, and resource-plateau breadth.

### 6.2.1 What the ultrawide over-retraction actually was

This document predicted for a long time that ultrawide over-retraction was the
conservative enclosing sphere standing in for the exact lens on the
authoritative boom, and that making the exact rounded-lens narrow phase
authoritative there would fix it. Two measurements say otherwise, and the
prediction is retained here because it was wrong in an instructive way.

**Every** elevated-emergency frame in the 24-arm matrix, in every aspect and
FOV arm, came from one call site: the boom-anchor search escalating directly to
`camera_obstruction_publish_elevated_emergency`. On those frames the exact
narrow phase was already authoritative and had already run: it independently
refused the pivot, the desired eye, and all 31 interior points of the authored
boom. The conservative sphere had refused too, so it was never the decider.
At large lens half-angles the authored boom *segment* genuinely contains no
valid pose — the anchor search is one-dimensional and the blocked set is not,
so the search set and the solution set simply do not intersect.

The sphere did still decide one thing that mattered: the shoulder fan's boom
admission was sphere-only. At 5120x1440 with an uncapped 140-degree lens it
rejected 3,672 of 3,700 candidate evaluations, so when the authored boom failed
there was no composition-preserving rung left and the emergency crane was the
only remaining option. That is exactly the class this section already forbids —
"every place where a sphere false positive can force emergency framing must
either use the exact result or deliberately record the conservative fallback" —
and it was simply an unenumerated instance of it.

The fix is therefore in two parts, and neither is "add exactness to the boom":

1. The shoulder fan's boom admission (anchor probes and the anchor-to-candidate
   corridor) uses the exact rounded-lens narrow phase, with the candidate's own
   retargeted lens basis rather than the authored one. The cut interval keeps
   its orientation-free conservative sphere sweep: that is the one motion in
   the chain whose orientation changes, and this section requires either
   conservative SE(3) coverage or a declared discontinuity with validated
   endpoints there.
2. A boom with no valid anchor tries that fan before the elevated emergency
   fan. The shoulder keeps the authored boom distance and subject framing; the
   emergency candidate that was previously winning is a fixed world-axis offset
   from the pivot with a 78–147 unit lift and a forced retarget.

The fan's exact anchor search is bounded (it stops at the bracket instead of
running the authored boom's 31-probe interior scan) because eleven unbounded
candidates a tick moved the measured 4P finalizer tail from 268us to 1.687ms.
Bounded, it is p99 220us / max 428us against the section 7.6 budgets of 833us
and 1.667ms, from 150us / 268us before.

The residual 4–7 frames per wide arm are frames where the shoulder fan also
finds nothing. They are honest emergencies, not the escalation defect.

### 6.3 Exact-lens critical path from shadow to production

This order is mandatory. Later visual polish cannot be used to bypass an earlier
geometry, cost, or authority exit:

| Order / owner | Engineering deliverable | Automated verification | Exit evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| PERF-01 geometry — implementation complete, release evidence open | `842d62f` replaces the production sampled interval fallback with a 96-test continuous Lipschitz interval proof. The sampled implementation is reachable only through the ROM-free oracle API. Count SAT, bounded tests/exhaustion, stationary tests, and refinements; budget exhaustion returns `INVALID`, and two-phase composition retains the conservative sphere `HIT`. | Property/fuzz corpus compares production against the oracle across translation, scale, tangent, initial-overlap, face/edge/vertex, high-coordinate, and thin/oversized triangles under Clang/GCC, strict warnings, ASan/UBSan, and wasm32. Inject every work-cap boundary. | Zero false clears versus the oracle; zero ordinary-route sampled fallbacks; stationary-test p99 <= 64 and max <= 128; deterministic hit bytes and stable-ID ordering. |
| PERF-02 collision — implementation complete, release evidence open | `d8c8bb7` builds stable-order eight-triangle chunks and an auxiliary deterministic balanced BVH, validates topology/coverage/containment before publication, checks generation and integrity during both sphere/exact traversal, and enforces aggregate instance/node/chunk/triangle/stationary budgets. `da93930` adds identity/rotated/scaled equivalence and malformed-node/chunk/per-model-cap/generation fault tests against the production representation. | Aggregate multi-instance cap injection, whole-ROM model census, repeated real load/free/address-reuse soak, and moving-door snapshot tests. | Dynamic p99 <= 2 instances, max <= 4; maximum 64 nodes/32 chunks/256 retained triangles/128 stationary tests per corridor; zero truncation/invalid/degraded results; cache within recorded load/memory budgets. |
| RUNTIME-01 camera/render — implementation complete, fault fixture open | Store renderer-derived exact guard and full fallback tuple per slot. Ordinary boom queries use the two-phase result. Alternate, emergency, recovery, scripted, stationary, and post-validation build and validate the final `Camera` orientation; publication performs no later retarget. Dynamic invalidity is never cleared or published, and failed ticks retire camera/object interpolation history. | Add a ROM-free state-machine seam that injects exact clear/hit/invalid, dynamic census failure/recovery, generation mismatch, stale tuple, final retarget, and orientation-changing interpolation. Runtime fixtures assert identical open-space bytes, authored fallback on source failure, and conservative sphere hit on healthy exact-work exhaustion. | Zero final-pose penetration or hidden resolvable target; zero stale generations; invalid never clears; failed publication cannot be snapshotted or interpolated; recovery requires a complete fresh tuple. |
| MOTION-01 design/QA — instrumentation complete, thresholds and tuning open | Tune expansion-only spring/hysteresis and deterministic shot scoring after safety decisions stabilize. Mark orientation-changing cuts discontinuous unless an SE(3) sweep is implemented. The per-family profile table (§7.3.1) is now an explicit three-value enum so a route can be measured under a different profile without editing a correction stage. | `tests/check_camera_motion_quality.py` drives the three pinned routes under Modern and reads the runtime's `camera_motion` census: jerk, retract latency, recovery duration, blocker churn, shoulder flips, emergency dwell, and discontinuity density. Hard chatter/shoulder/dwell invariants assert; the analog metrics are reported as the calibration baseline. A 240 Hz interpolated arm reports cut density per displayed frame. The reduced-motion control is no longer open: it shipped as `Camera.Comfort` (§7.9), which covers both halves of this row — the vertical shake and the recovery rate — as presentation-only transforms, because the authored shake itself is authoritative state (`platform/sim_hash.c`) and cannot be gated at its source. | Numeric thresholds pass and worst 1% clips receive signed manual review across 4:3, ultrawide, portrait, and split-screen. What the first capture found, and what closing it cost, is recorded in §7.3.2. **Thresholds need recalibration before any future default flip (§10.1):** every one of them was satisfied by the build device acceptance rejected on 2026-08-07 as too sensitive in play. Passing this row as currently tuned is necessary and demonstrably not sufficient, and rerunning it unchanged is not new evidence. |
| VIS-01 rendering/content | Add reviewed soft-occluder policy and generation-keyed, per-viewport, batch-local fade. The interim decline (small dynamic blockers that are neither close nor cheap stop retracting a race camera, after the authored lens validates exact-clear of the complete occluder set) is in place but has no measured target: on the hub route the only dynamic blockers are two door instances of ~302 unit half-extent, every small prop is already excluded from the camera hard set as non-solid, and static track triangles carry no comparable size at all. Hard geometry continues to require clearance; emergency racer fade remains presentation-only. | Two-view opposing visibility fixture, opaque/cutout/translucent pixels, freed-ID reuse, state/RNG/event/audio hashes, and GL/WebGPU/browser screenshots. | No cross-viewport contamination, no hard-wall fade substitution, no gameplay mutation, and approved content census. |
| RELEASE-01 QA/release | Rerun the complete current-revision matrix in optimized artifacts and archive the evidence schema below. Flip the default only in a dedicated reviewed commit with immediate Observe rollback. | 84 registered tests plus release suite, GCC/Clang, sanitizers, native backends, wasm/browser, resource plateau, load time, long 4P soak, same-binary Legacy/center-ray negative controls. | Not met, and the protocol is what caught it. The change was dedicated and reviewed — the branch altered the camera default and the reduced-motion option ownership required to ship with it, and nothing else — and the immediate Observe rollback existed as written and was used: device acceptance rejected the default on 2026-08-07 and it was reverted the same day at a setting's cost. "Every CAM/LENS row green" did not happen; §10.1 records what was substituted for it and what that substitution missed. |

Absolute screen-size independence is evaluated in world space: pixel resolution
must not alter a trace when effective aspect/FOV are equal, while each distinct
viewport shape gets its own latched projection and exact guard. The rollout must
therefore compare equal-aspect identity separately from 4:3/16:9/21:9/32:9,
portrait, split-screen, FOV-cap, DPI, fullscreen, and live-resize coverage.

Every final evidence row must record:

```text
gate | commit/binary | ROM hash | platform/backend | viewport/FOV/aspect |
route/seed | policy | trace/capture path | assertions | result | reviewer/date
```

### 6.4 Release execution protocol

The remaining work is executed in six reviewable waves. A wave may prepare later
fixtures, but it cannot declare their gate satisfied until every predecessor is
green on the same candidate commit. “Pass” means the raw trace/capture and parser
result are archived; a terminal summary alone is not evidence.

| Wave | Engineering output | Test/validation output | Promotion rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| A — adversarial fixtures | Add injectable dynamic-census invalid/recovery, non-door chord, thick-wall embedded target, concave corner, tunnel, rotating door, tuple mutation, and simultaneous resize/projection-fault seams. Keep each fault behind test-only or deterministic route control. | Every fixture has a positive control that fails for the intended reason and a Modern arm that either publishes a fully proven pose or deliberately publishes no sidecar and cuts. | No `INVALID -> CLEAR`, no stale snapshot/interpolation source, no unsafe pose, and stable provenance bytes over repeated seeds. |
| B — geometry and content breadth | Add the dense temporal-envelope oracle; inject aggregate multi-instance work caps; rerun every legal vehicle/track row and all 20 tracks; repeatedly load/free models and reuse object addresses. | Clang/GCC native units, ASan/UBSan, wasm build, 47/47 vehicle/track and 20/20 track reports, cache/work histograms, memory plateau, and load-time delta. | Zero false clears versus oracle, omission, unclassified hard material, stale generation, truncation, invalid/degraded healthy route, or unbounded memory growth. |
| C — motion product quality | Instrument retract latency, recovery duration, positional/angular velocity and jerk, blocker churn, shot-side flips, emergency/fade dwell, and discontinuity density. Tune only expansion/recovery/shot scoring; hard clearance is immutable. | Deterministic routes at 20/30/50/60 fixed cadence and 20–240 Hz presentation, shake on/off, reduced-motion, 1P–4P, 4:3/portrait/16:9/21:9/32:9, authored/FOV extrema. Archive worst 1% clips. | Section 7.3 numeric bounds pass; no repeatable nausea, steering ambiguity, shoulder flap, or prolonged unreadable framing in signed design/QA review. |
| D — visibility policy | Finish the fingerprinted hard/soft/nonblocking census. Either implement generation-keyed per-viewport batch-local soft fade or record an explicit release deferral. Never fade hard geometry. | Opposing split-view pixels, opaque/cutout/translucent fixtures, freed-ID reuse, GL/WebGPU/browser captures, and state/event/RNG/audio hashes. | No cross-viewport contamination, object/global material write, hard-wall substitution, identity leak, or authority delta. |
| E — platform parity and soak | Build optimized current source with Clang, GCC, and Emscripten; run native GL, native WebGPU, and Chromium, including fullscreen, DPR, live resize, projection fault, minimize/resume, pause/restart, and repeated level transitions. | Backend-equivalent safety/authority counters, browser frame/load distributions, 30-minute 4P obstruction soak, teardown diagnostics, and resource plateau. | Correctness matches native reference; p99/load/memory budgets in sections 7.6 and 10 pass; no sanitizer, browser console, teardown, or timing regression. |
| F — default decision | Freeze tuning and evidence schema; rerun the entire matrix from clean optimized artifacts; perform independent code, gameplay, and release review. Change only the default in a dedicated commit. | Signed CAM-00–CAM-09 and LENS-01–LENS-08 ledger, release note, rollback drill, ROM/build fingerprints, and archived captures/traces. | **Open again as of 2026-08-07.** The written bar was "every row green". It was substituted for on 2026-08-07 by the §10.1 measurements, the default was flipped, and the *gameplay review* this row also requires then rejected it on device — so the row is not superseded after all, and is recorded as unmet. The rollback worked exactly as written: a player-facing setting and a re-seeded default, no build, no save migration. Any future attempt owes the gameplay-review clause first, not last. |

Each engineering change follows the same loop:

1. Add or identify a failing positive control before changing policy.
2. Implement without broadening gameplay authority or mutating collision/object
   state.
3. Run ROM-free unit/source/fault tests, then the smallest deterministic ROM route.
4. Run the affected display/multiplayer/lifecycle/performance matrix on an
   optimized artifact; run sanitizer and alternate-toolchain tiers when geometry,
   lifetime, transform, or publication code changes.
5. Archive counters and captures using the evidence schema, update the ledger,
   and request the named review. Never waive a failed hard invariant through a
   threshold or content exception.

CI tiers are explicit:

- per-change: source authority guards, the registered native tests,
  geometry/fault units;
- camera-integration: same-binary controls, dynamic route, projection fault,
  emergency readability, 3P+T.T., and selected lifecycle route;
- nightly: display/FOV matrix, current 20-track/47-row breadth, 4P performance,
  sanitizers, model/address-reuse soak;
- release: all nightly gates plus GCC, GL/WebGPU/Chromium/wasm parity, manual
  worst-1% review, clean-install/load/teardown and rollback drill.

Failure ownership follows the first broken invariant: geometry/source failures go
to camera-collision engineering; stale generations or publication go to
camera/presentation; motion-only failures go to camera design; material/fade
failures go to rendering/content; authority/hash deltas go to gameplay/platform.
A downstream visual workaround never closes an upstream safety failure.

### Implemented and remaining file seams

- `platform/camera_obstruction.{c,h}`, `camera_obstruction_resolver.{c,h}`,
  `camera_obstruction_transform.{c,h}`, and `camera_obstruction_query.{c,h}`:
  dependency-light geometry, temporal policy, transforms, and source composition.
- `platform/display_config.{c,h}` and `game/src/camera.c`: exact per-viewport
  projection records and generation ownership.
- `game/src/thread3_main.c`: the single authoritative finalizer call in gameplay
  and loaded-scene paths.
- `game/src/racer.c`: desired pivot/focus metadata only; no duplicated collision
  solver in vehicle modes.
- `game/src/tracks.c`: static occlusion-world build/lifetime and resolved segment
  consumption; retain the void curtain as a fallback/background mechanism, not the
  primary correction.
- `game/src/objects.c`: stable object enumeration and read-only transforms; do not
  reuse interaction-mutating collision entry points.
- `game/src/camera_obstruction_runtime.{c,h}`,
  `camera_dynamic_occlusion.{c,h}`, and `camera_object_occlusion.{c,h}`: native
  sidecar, policy integration, and immutable dynamic/model cache ownership.
- `platform/presentation_snapshot*`: resolved pose/projection/discontinuity when
  diagnostic snapshots are enabled.
- ROM-free resolver/transform/query tests, authority/cache/dynamic/observe source
  guards, and `tests/check_camera_obstruction_runtime.py`; focused remaining
  screen/multiplayer/mode fixtures stay release-blocking.
- `CMakeLists.txt`, `tools/run_checks.py`, `tests/README.md`, release checklist,
  changelog, and open-item closeout when the work lands.

## 7. Test and validation program

### 7.1 ROM-free geometry units

Synthetic cases must include:

- no hit and exact endpoint touch;
- perpendicular and oblique walls;
- triangle face, edge, vertex, seam, and T-junction;
- paper-thin and two-sided shells;
- start inside, pivot inside, camera inside, and no valid boom;
- multiple blockers with stable earliest-hit and equal-fraction tie cases;
- degenerate/zero-area triangles, extreme coordinates, NaN/Inf rejection;
- rotated/scaled object-local meshes and moving transforms;
- stock 4:3 guard near 13.88, widescreen/high-FOV guards, portrait, and FOV cap;
- desired orientation changing after retraction;
- legacy center-ray positive control that passes while a near corner intersects;
- stable results after candidate/BVH insertion order is deliberately permuted.

Property/fuzz assertions:

- returned fraction is finite and in `[0, 1]`;
- moving no farther than the reported safe fraction is clear within tolerance;
- moving beyond a real hit violates clearance;
- increasing the guard cannot increase the safe boom;
- translating or uniformly scaling the entire scene transforms the answer
  consistently;
- query inputs and world are byte-identical before/after.

### 7.2 Runtime integration fixtures

Required deterministic routes:

- Ancient Lake canyon wall contact and high-speed wall approach;
- concave corner, tunnel ceiling, under-bridge, and narrow corridor;
- Timber's Island locked door and door opening while obstructing;
- moving/rotating solid object crossing the boom;
- car, hovercraft, and plane at every zoom, boost, reverse, drift, spinout, and
  maximum practical boom;
- loop entry/exit and roll continuity;
- Taj dialogue translation plus maximum shake near a wall;
- challenge finish orbit, normal finish spectate, fixed door, cutscene camera bank,
  P2 control promotion, 3P T.T., and 4P;
- pause/FOV change, live resize, minimize/resume, stage unload/reload, race restart,
  and camera-mode teleport.

Every route records geometric telemetry and selected pixel frames. Pixel tests prove
the visible symptom; geometric tests prove the camera did not merely hide it.

### 7.3 Motion-quality gates

Initial release targets, to be calibrated by CAM-00 and then frozen before CAM-06
implementation:

- unsafe clearance is corrected in the same authored tick; there is no one-frame
  grace period;
- with desired pose and blocker set held constant, resolved boom expansion is
  monotonic and reaches at least 95% of the clear desired boom within 750 ms for a
  correction up to 250 world units and 1.25 seconds for a larger correction;
- expansion advances no more than 20 world units or 25% of remaining error per
  authored tick, whichever is smaller, unless a mode transition marks a
  discontinuity;
- no clear/blocked/clear or left/right/left correction cycle occurs inside 12
  authored ticks unless the intermediate pose became geometrically invalid;
- triangle/facet changes within one hard object or continuous track surface do not
  reset recovery or count as a new blocker owner;
- emergency snaps, overlap depenetrations, and alternate-shot switches are all
  counted and must appear in the visual-review queue; none may be silently folded
  into ordinary recovery statistics;
- a 30-minute manual review covering high-speed 1P, 2P, ultrawide, and maximum-FOV
  play reports no repeatable correction-induced nausea, shoulder flapping, loss of
  racer readability, or steering ambiguity.

These are falsifiable starting bounds, not magic constants. CAM-00 may revise them
once, with traces and side-by-side captures recorded in this document. Later tuning
requires the same evidence and may not weaken hard clearance.

#### 7.3.1 Per-family correction profiles

Every authored camera family resolves to exactly one profile, and the profile
names which correction stages that family consents to. This is a table, not a
ladder:

| Profile | Sweep | Retract | Recovery | Alternate fan | Emergency framing |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `FULL` | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| `SAFETY_ONLY` | yes | yes | yes | **no** | yes |
| `DEPENETRATE_ONLY` | yes | no | no | no | eye push only |

`SAFETY_ONLY` is the racing profile: the eye stays on the authored pivot→eye ray
and may only move along it. A shot whose composition is already load-bearing for
steering may be shortened, but it may not be swung sideways.

The shipped table is CAR/HOVERCRAFT/PLANE/finish/T.T.-spectate → `FULL`,
LOOP → `SAFETY_ONLY`, FIXED and scripted cutscene → `DEPENETRATE_ONLY`. The LOOP
row is the old inline `family != LOOP` alternate-fan exclusion given a name; it
is not a behavior change, and the equivalence is asserted by an exact trace diff
against the pre-table revision.

`MDKR_CAMERA_PROFILE_FORCE=<family>:<profile>[,…]` (or `all:<profile>`) overrides
the table for measurement. It is diagnostic-only, gated like the other
diagnostic environment seams, and an unparsable entry is reported and ignored
rather than silently applied — a measurement run that did not get the profile it
asked for is the one result a reader cannot tell apart from the shipped table.

#### 7.3.2 First motion capture, and what it found

`tests/check_camera_motion_quality.py` drives the Ancient Lake race, Timber's
Island hub tour, and 3P+T.T. spectate routes under Modern and reports the
distributions above. It found two things. Neither was a safety regression —
`penetrated=0 degraded=0 invalid=0` held on every route throughout:

1. **Correction dropout against a wall the camera is still on — closed.** On
   the 3P route the correction disengaged, the boom popped toward the desired
   pose, and the correction re-engaged, five times inside the 12-tick chatter
   window. The first read of this was "a single tick at a facet seam", from the
   clearest instance (blocker `317` → one clear tick → blocker `319`).
   Reconstructing the phase machine from the level-2 trace corrected that: the
   five clear runs are **1, 1, 3, 4 and 7 ticks**, and two of them have the
   *identical* blocker id on both sides (`780` → 3 clear ticks → `780`), which
   is what proves the gap is a false negative of the swept-volume query rather
   than a wall the kart drove past. The static blocker stable ID is per source
   face (`tracks.c` increments it per triangle), so blocker churn alone cannot
   distinguish these cases; the census classifies churn by contact normal and
   reports facet churn separately.

   The resolver now carries an explicit release band on retraction (§4.2):
   contact still retracts on the tick it is seen, and a latched retraction
   holds the boom at its retracted length until the corridor has been clear for
   nine consecutive ticks. Measured cost across the three routes is 64, 103 and
   67 held ticks — 8, 13 and 12 dropouts absorbed — out of 5187, 11992 and
   20463 slot ticks. Retract latency stays 0/0/0/0. Recovery duration does not
   get worse: on the 3P route the count of recovery events falls 7 → 3 as the
   spurious dropout-triggered recoveries disappear, and the longest recovery
   falls 36 → 33 ticks. Emergency dwell is unchanged on all three routes.

   A held tick is deliberately not allowed to open the alternate-shot fan. The
   fan's 0.55 severity clause asks whether the authored ray is obstructed badly
   enough to be worth leaving, and a held tick's answer to "obstructed?" is a
   sweep result the resolver has just decided not to trust. Letting it through
   was measured: it swung the 3P boom onto a lifted candidate for two ticks and
   dropped it again, a 236 wu single-tick step. The 0.70 clause still holds an
   already-active alternate shot across a hold, which is that shot's own
   hysteresis.

2. **Published-cut density — measured at rate, no threshold set.** Modern marks
   17–132 presentation cuts per 1000 resolved slot ticks depending on route,
   nearly all attributed to the transition validator declining to prove an
   interpolation-safe path. At the authored present rate this is invisible,
   because interpolation is a no-op there. The gate now carries a high-rate arm
   that re-drives Ancient Lake — the worst of the three — at
   `MDKR_PRESENT_RATE=240` with the public `MotionSmoothing=interpolate`
   setting, four displayed frames per authored tick. The cut rate per 1000 slot
   ticks comes out at 132.0609, identical to the authored-rate run, which is the
   expected result and the arm's own sanity check: the census lives on the
   authored grid and presentation rate must not move it. Restated per displayed
   frame, that is **3.28% of frames landing on a cut, one every 30.5 frames**.
   The arm asserts nothing about those numbers; it asserts only that it really
   ran at the rate and route length it claims, because an arm that quietly
   degraded to the authored rate would publish an authored-rate number under a
   high-rate heading. Whether 3.28% is acceptable before camera default-on is
   the cut-density decision, and this is the number it needs.

The literal "no clear/blocked/clear cycle inside 12 ticks" bound is measured and
reported, but is **not** the check's hard assertion: on the lake route every
short blocked span is a single stable blocker entered once and left once — a
kart driving past a distinct wall facet, which the wording cannot tell apart
from chatter. The hard assertion is that the correction does not come *back*
inside the window. A signed review may overrule that reading; the raw count is
in the report either way.

The first `FULL` vs `SAFETY_ONLY` comparison on the two race routes says the
alternate fan is close to irrelevant on ordinary racing and load-bearing at the
margin. Aggregate resolved-camera velocity, acceleration, and jerk are identical
between the two profiles to five decimal places on both routes, because the
correction touches on the order of 2% of ticks and the fan itself fires about
once per 5000. Where they differ, `SAFETY_ONLY` leans harder on emergency
framing — maximum dwell 1→4 ticks on the lake route and 3→20 on the 3P route —
and the lake route picks up one correction re-engagement it does not have under
`FULL`. So the racing profile is not free: removing the fan does not smooth the
camera, it converts a shoulder step into a longer emergency hold. Choosing it
has to be argued on composition, not on these numbers.

### 7.4 Display matrix

At minimum:

- 320x240 and 640x480 4:3;
- 1280x720, 1920x1080, and 3840x2160 16:9;
- 1920x1200 16:10;
- 2560x1080 and 3440x1440 21:9;
- 5120x1440 32:9;
- 1080x1920 portrait and a narrow resizable browser viewport;
- forced 4:3 inside widescreen;
- authored FOVs in the asset census, user minimum/default/maximum, and horizontal
  cap engaged/disengaged;
- SSAA 1x/2x/4x and GL/WebGPU/browser.

Do not create redundant world-space goldens for resolutions sharing an aspect.
Instead assert identical camera traces and use resolution-specific pixels only for
render/UI coverage.

### 7.5 Multiplayer and authority

- Compare 1P, 2P, 3P+T.T., and 4P camera IDs, solve counts, blockers, segments, and
  per-viewport fades.
- Move only one viewport's racer into an obstruction; every other viewport's camera,
  object route, opacity, and pixels must remain unchanged.
- Compare fixed/legacy arms for simulation state, gameplay events, consumed input,
  RNG stream, sound-event stream, and PCM. State/events/input/RNG/sound events must
  be identical; a delta blocks rollout. PCM may differ only through the audited
  resolved listener transform, must be deterministic for that pose, and must have
  an unchanged dry/event control. If the audio census shows that preserving logical
  listener position is less disruptive, record that product decision explicitly.
- Specifically measure `obj_visibility_tick()` racer admissions and resulting AI
  timers/steering from the logical basis. The resolved presentation camera may
  change pixels and draw admission, but may not change this simulation trace.

### 7.6 Performance, memory, and lifecycle

Telemetry per tick and viewport:

- broadphase nodes/triangles visited;
- hard/soft object candidates;
- sweep/refinement/alternate-shot query counts;
- cache bytes and build time;
- query time, correction distance, blocker ID, overlap/fallback events;
- projection/pose generations and segment transitions.

Release budgets:

- zero allocations during camera query/finalize;
- zero capacity truncations and zero unclassified occluders;
- measure the inclusive fixed-tick finalizer (authored snapshot, dynamic
  publication, every selected slot solve, and post-validation, excluding
  diagnostic `fprintf`) at the fastest supported NTSC cadence. It is no more than
  833,333 ns (5% of 16.667 ms) at p99 on the reference host; no more than 1% of
  samples may exceed that bound;
- record every sample above 1,666,667 ns (10%). An isolated release run permits at
  most 0.1% as an OS/browser scheduling tail and requires each to be reviewed;
  max is reported but is not a portable hard gate because descheduling and browser
  GC are not camera work. A repeatable algorithmic tail is release-fatal;
- separately report per-slot, static-query, dynamic-query, dynamic-publication,
  query-count, and zero-duration/browser timer bins. Static query fan is bounded
  at 64 calls per finalizer in the 4P gate;
- level-load cache construction adds no more than 10% to measured level-load time
  and remains within an explicitly recorded memory budget;
- browser/wasm32 meets the same correctness gates and reports its own time/memory
  distribution rather than inheriting native results.

`MDKR_CAMERA_PERF=1` uses a preallocated 10-us histogram and SDL's intra-thread
performance counter. It does not use the VI/rAF pacing clock, which is intentionally
frozen inside synthetic browser opportunities and would report false zeroes. When
disabled, it performs no clock reads or allocation. The release gate runs Observe
and Modern from one optimized binary, requires byte-identical state streams, and
records absolute cost as well as their delta.

Run Debug, Release, ASan, full alignment/undefined UBSan, GCC, supported native
backends, and browser WebGPU. Include repeated level load/unload, pause/restart, and
at least one long 4P obstruction soak to prove sidecar/object-generation cleanup.

### 7.7 Required existing regressions

At minimum run the registered equivalents of:

```text
display_config
video_config / video_config_runtime
presentation_snapshot
race_drive
door_blocks
collision_gridmask / collision_headroom / collision_untextured
race 2P / race multiplayer / viewport route isolation
challenge modes / Taj challenges / trophy series / first boss progression
determinism / authored RNG compatibility / state hash / render purity
camera snapshot coverage / presentation lifecycle and breadth
renderer backends / widescreen proportions / browser runtime
array bounds / native layout / full UBSan / resource plateau
```

The new gate is registered in `tools/run_checks.py`; it is not a manual-only script.

### 7.8 Same-binary controls

Add a diagnostic seam such as:

```text
unset | observe                  current default; telemetry only, authored pose
                                 retained
MDKR_CAMERA_OBSTRUCTION=modern   the player-facing opt-in; full static+dynamic
                                 correction, running the §7.3.1 per-family
                                 treatment table. The launcher's
                                 Camera.Obstruction setting exports this
MDKR_CAMERA_OBSTRUCTION=center-ray intentionally incomplete diagnostic control
MDKR_CAMERA_OBSTRUCTION=legacy   original direct placement + void detector
MDKR_CAMERA_COMFORT=reduced      presentation-only reduced motion (§7.9)
MDKR_CAMERA_TRACE=1|2             summaries / per-query detail
MDKR_CAMERA_EXACT_SHADOW=1        non-publishing promoted-sphere/exact corridor comparison
```

Unknown values fail to Observe, the default and the only arm that measures
without moving a camera: a typo may neither silently correct nor silently select
the known-unsafe Legacy behavior or the incomplete Center-ray control. (This
landing point followed the default to Modern for part of 2026-08-07 and came
back with it.) The fallback must not be
silent even though it lands where an unset variable does, because that is
exactly the case a caller cannot tell apart from their request being honoured:
the first unparsed resolution prints one `camera_obstruction:` line to stderr
naming the rejected value and the valid set, and never repeats — the policy
resolves per slot per fixed tick. The immediate rollback ladder is
`modern -> observe -> legacy`, with no save persistence or authoritative-state
migration; `observe` is a supported player-facing state and is now also the
default, so the first rung of that ladder is one setting away and needs no
build. The 2026-08-07 acceptance reversal used exactly that rung, and the
build-side change was a re-seeded default rather than a code path.

The legacy arm must reproduce the wall/door lens violation in the same executable.
The modern arm must pass the invariant. A second injected control disables only the
near-plane guard while retaining a center ray, proving the test distinguishes a
point camera from a protected lens.

The `center-ray` and `legacy` arms are diagnostic and environment/CLI-only. They
are not persisted to saves and do not become player-facing quality knobs;
`modern` and `observe` are, and are persisted as `Camera.Obstruction`.

### 7.9 Camera.Comfort — reduced motion

A presentation-only accessibility opt-in, defaulting to `authored`. It shares the
CAMERA apply domain and the level boundary with `Camera.Obstruction`, so both
keys reach the runtime through one applier and are cleared by one reset. Two
effects, both inside the sidecar:

1. **Vertical smoothing of the desired eye.** `racer.c`'s authored camera folds
   a shake impulse into the camera's height every tick
   (`trans.y_position += y_velocity + shakeMagnitude`), reversing sign every 5
   authored ticks — roughly a 6 Hz vertical oscillation on a 30 Hz simulation.
   The impulse cannot be suppressed at its source: `platform/sim_hash.c` hashes
   `gCameras[PLAYER_FOUR].trans` and `shakeMagnitude` as **authoritative**,
   because the 3P/T.T. camera pose feeds next-tick object sort, LOD and
   visibility. Nor can the sidecar subtract the shake back out, because each
   camera mode then drags that height toward its own target with a
   mode-specific, per-tick retention; no scalar reconstructs the shake-free
   height, and inventing one would be a guess dressed as an inverse. So comfort
   applies a one-pole low-pass (tau 0.13 s, derived from `fixed_delta_seconds`
   so `Video.SimulationCadence` cannot change it) to the resolver's **desired**
   eye. Desired, not resolved: the published pose is the one proven clear of
   geometry, and a lagged copy of it is proven clear of nothing. Smoothing the
   input leaves every downstream layer — anchor, retraction, alternate fan,
   emergency framing, publication, post-validation — proving its own pose as
   before. The filter re-seeds on a discontinuity so a cut stays a cut, and it
   is not applied to DEPENETRATE_ONLY families for the same reason they are
   DEPENETRATE_ONLY: a door or scripted-cutscene shot is an authored
   composition owned by the shot contract, and a fixed door camera has no
   vertical shake to remove.
2. **A gentler boom recovery.** `recovery_speed` and `max_recovery_step` scale
   by 0.4. The resolver bounds only expansion; retraction engages on contact
   with zero latency and no cap, so this cannot leave the camera inside geometry
   for one tick longer than it otherwise would. `release_hold_ticks` is
   deliberately not scaled: the hysteresis is a false-negative fix, not a motion
   knob, and lengthening it would trade correctness for comfort.

Proof obligations are the camera's own. `check_camera_obstruction_performance_runtime`
runs a third arm (`modern` + `MDKR_CAMERA_COMFORT=reduced`) whose authoritative
state stream must be byte-identical to the plain `modern` arm, and
`check_camera_obstruction_runtime` asserts the comfort arm publishes zero
penetrated poses while producing a *different* resolved trace — a comfort option
that silently no-ops fails.

## 8. Rollout and tuning

1. **Observe:** land CAM-00 instrumentation and fixtures with production behavior
   unchanged.
2. **Dark launch:** build caches and run queries without applying correction; compare
   predicted hits to captures and classify false positives/negatives.
3. **Terrain default:** enable hard track correction for ordinary follow cameras,
   retaining legacy A/B.
4. **Object and breadth default:** add doors/moving solids and all camera banks/modes.
5. **Polish:** enable alternate shots, soft fades, racer emergency fade, and player
   accessibility controls only after safety evidence is stable.
6. **Closeout:** run full release matrix, update the open item/changelog/handbook, and
   retain the legacy seam for at least one release cycle.

Tuning is data-driven. Produce heatmaps by track, mode, vehicle, viewport, blocker,
correction distance, and obstruction duration. Review the worst 1% of events
visually. Fix bad authored spectate points or misclassified assets at the content
policy rather than weakening global safety.

Suggested later player-facing controls:

- camera shake strength/off;
- obstruction recovery feel: responsive versus smooth, changing expansion only;
- racer emergency fade strength.

None may reduce hard clearance. FOV remains owned by the existing display settings.

## 9. Risk register and stop conditions

| Risk | Detection | Mitigation / stop condition |
|---|---|---|
| Camera correction or display choice changes AI via visibility | logical-admission/RNG/state A/B | Keep AI activity on desired pose + canonical authored projection; any delta stops rollout |
| Visual cache blocks invisible or soft material | provenance census + dark launch | Reclassify by stable asset/batch policy; do not lower global clearance |
| Visual cache misses `NO_COLLISION` geometry | legacy witness plus visual-triangle census | Final target includes opaque visual triangles, not gameplay facets alone |
| Ultrawide over-retracts | 24-arm elevated-emergency rates per aspect and FOV band | Closed for the escalation defect (section 6.2.1); the residual 4-7 frames per wide arm are frames with no shoulder either |
| Corner oscillation/shoulder flipping | blocker/candidate trace and motion metrics | hysteresis, prior-shot score, deterministic minimum dwell; stop if rapid alternation persists |
| Focus starts in geometry | overlap counters and targeted fixtures | depenetration/last-safe/emergency framing; never loop at zero boom |
| Resize races projection | generation assertions | latch pose/projection atomically; fail closed on mismatch |
| Dynamic object address reuse | generation soak under ASan | generation-key all blocker/fade state and clear on free/stage reset |
| Query stalls 4P/browser | p99/max telemetry | BVH/local-space caches, bounded alternates; do not accept truncation as optimization |
| Snapshot interpolation crosses wall | midpoint geometric control | revalidate sample or force discontinuity; do not re-enable smoothing on endpoint evidence alone |
| Void curtain masks remaining defect | modern run with void detector telemetry | geometric gate must pass with masking ignored; curtain is not acceptance evidence |
| Fidelity disputes | open-space byte identity + legacy seam | safe default, diagnostic legacy; document deliberate obstructed-shot differences |

## 10. Definition of done

The issue may be marked fixed only when all statements are true:

- Every CAM-00 through CAM-09 exit gate is satisfied.
- No required route reports hard lens penetration, stale segment identity, query
  truncation, unclassified hard material, invalid projection generation, or camera
  query side effects.
- Open-space desired and resolved poses are identical; equal-aspect resolutions
  produce identical camera traces.
- Simulation state, AI logical-admission trace, gameplay events, consumed input,
  RNG, and sound-event stream are invariant across legacy/modern correction and the
  complete display/FOV matrix. Any PCM delta is deterministic and isolated to the
  explicitly chosen camera-listener policy; no cue is added, removed, or reordered.
- All player, cutscene, promoted, and T.T. camera IDs used by loaded worlds have an
  explicit policy and coverage.
- Terrain, visible non-gameplay-collision geometry, closed doors, and moving solids
  are covered; soft/nonblocking exclusions are enumerated.
- Retraction/recovery, emergency framing, and alternate-shot motion pass numeric and
  visual review without seam chatter or shoulder flapping.
- 1P–4P, GL, WebGPU, browser, 4:3 through 32:9, portrait, FOV extremes, live resize,
  pause, lifecycle, sanitizers, determinism, state/event/input/RNG/PCM, performance,
  and memory gates pass.
- Same-binary legacy and center-ray controls demonstrably fail the exact invariants
  the production path passes.
- The consumer census and source guard cover every camera reader.
- Release notes state the safe-camera product decision and any intentional
  obstructed-shot fidelity differences.

Anything less is a partial mitigation and remains open in this document.

### 10.1 The 2026-08-07 default flip, and its reversal the same day

**Outcome first: the flip was built, gated, taken — and reverted. The default is
`observe` again. Correction ships as an opt-in.**

Two things happened on 2026-08-07 and this subsection records both, because the
second is the more useful engineering fact.

**The flip.** The bar this section and §6.4's row F wrote down was *every
CAM-00–CAM-09 and LENS-01–LENS-08 row green*. That bar was not met, and this
subsection exists so nobody reads the flip as evidence that it was. Ownership
took the decision on the measurements below instead. Recording the substitution
is the point; a gate table that quietly relaxes to match what shipped is worth
nothing.

**The reversal.** The default-on build then went to human device acceptance and
was rejected there. The verdict, verbatim: *"the camera thing is too
sensitive/causes issues."* Nothing in the instrumented ladder below regressed —
every row cited as load-bearing was still green when the default was pulled.
The correction was not withdrawn and no code path was removed; only the seeded
default and the launcher's ordering changed, which is exactly the cheap
reversal §7.8's rollback ladder promised.

**What that costs this document.** The measured case for default-on was
*necessary and not sufficient*, and that is the finding worth carrying forward.
MOTION-01's chatter, shoulder-flip, emergency-dwell and jerk/latency thresholds
were all satisfied by a camera that a person playing the game on a device
described as too sensitive. So the thresholds are not calibrated against the
thing they are proxies for. **Before any future flip attempt, MOTION-01's
thresholds must be recalibrated against this verdict** — the specific play the
owner rejected has to become a case the gate can fail on — and a device
acceptance pass has to be a named row in the ladder rather than a step after
it. A rerun of the same numbers is not new evidence for the same decision.

The tables below are kept as written, and are the record of the flip that was
taken. They are no longer a description of the shipped default.

**Rows the flip rested on — green, load-bearing, and still green at the
reversal:**

| Row | What closed it |
| --- | --- |
| CAM-01 | The 24-arm shape/FOV display matrix (`check_camera_obstruction_display_matrix`): 4:3 low/high, 16:9, 21:9, 32:9, portrait, across authored/20/140-capped/140-uncapped FOV. Zero penetrated poses on every arm, and equal-aspect 320x240 and 1280x960 produce identical camera traces. |
| CAM-04 | `check_camera_obstruction_performance_runtime` compares the Observe and Modern authoritative state streams over the full route and requires byte identity. The presentation/authority split is measured, not asserted. |
| CAM-06 | MOTION-01 (`check_camera_motion_quality`) passes its hard chatter, shoulder-flip and emergency-dwell invariants on all three pinned routes, and its reported jerk/latency baselines hold with correction as the default path rather than as an opt-in arm. The retraction release hold (`RELEASE_HOLD_TICKS = 9`) closed the measured false-clear runs at facet seams — the last motion defect standing between the correction and default-on. |
| CAM-06 / CAM-07 | Exact fan admission ended the emergency-crane escalation: emergency framings across the 24-arm matrix fell from 1585 to 46. The escalation was the readability objection to defaulting the follow families to FULL. |
| §7.3.1 treatment table | Per-family measurement, not taste. The FULL vs SAFETY_ONLY comparison (§7.3.1) found aggregate resolved-camera velocity/acceleration/jerk identical to five decimal places on both race routes, and SAFETY_ONLY *worse* where they differ: maximum emergency dwell 1→4 ticks on the lake route and 3→20 on the 3P route, plus a correction re-engagement FULL does not have. Removing the fan does not smooth the camera; it converts a shoulder step into a longer emergency hold. So the follow families ship FULL, including for racing — the case the opt-in default had been hedging against. Door and scripted-cutscene families take DEPENETRATE_ONLY on composition grounds, not as a fallback. |

**Rows that stayed amber, and why the flip did not wait for them:**

- **CAM-02, CAM-03, CAM-05** — outstanding items are *breadth of evidence*
  (arbitrary-orientation differential fuzzing, GCC/wasm32 sanitizer-equivalent
  runs, fingerprinted hard/soft policy approval, injected aggregate exhaustion,
  address-reuse soaks). None is a known defect; each is a corpus not yet run.
  They gate a claim about coverage, not the behaviour a player meets.
- **CAM-08** — soft-occluder enrollment and its pixel proof are genuinely
  unbuilt. VIS-01's interim rule (small dynamic blockers stop *retracting*, never
  stop being validated) means the gap costs a correction, never a safe pose.
- **CAM-09** — WebGPU/browser/resource-plateau breadth and manual motion review
  remain. Manual motion review is the row that ran next, and it is the row that
  reversed the decision.

**What made that trade acceptable, and what actually reversed it:** every amber
row above is a *coverage* row, and the correction is safe by construction rather
than by coverage — it substitutes only at presentation depth, so no amber row
could turn into moved authoritative state, and none did. What reversed the
decision was none of them. It was CAM-09's manual review arm: device acceptance,
by a person playing the game, finding the corrected camera too sensitive in play.
The reversal cost was as advertised — `Camera.Obstruction=observe` is a shipped,
tested, player-facing setting with its own gate arm, so the rollback was a
setting and a re-seeded default, not a build, and cost no save migration.

**The standing lesson.** Safe-by-construction is a claim about authority, not
about whether a camera is pleasant to play behind. Correctness gates cleared it;
a human did not. Any future attempt at this default needs the human judgement
encoded as a gate row *before* the flip, not discovered after it.
