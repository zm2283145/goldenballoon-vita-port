# Multiplayer threat model

Status: active security contract. Review on every protocol, origin, provider or
retention change. Local keyboard/gamepad play is outside the network trust
boundary and must remain available when every service is unavailable.

## Assets and boundaries

Protected assets are ROM/save bytes, controller authority, private-room
admission, gameplay integrity, account-free privacy, service availability and
the zero-spend ceiling. The launcher owns rooms, approval, seats and engine
lifetime. Game code consumes sanitized fixed-tick pad state and never sees URLs,
credentials, SDP, service SDKs or provider types. The controller page has no ROM,
save, wasm or game-asset route. Signaling is untrusted for gameplay authority.

## Abuse cases and mandatory controls

| Threat | Control | Executable evidence |
|---|---|---|
| QR screenshot/replay | 128-bit fragment capability, two-minute expiry, rotate on extend/reopen, revoke on sheet dismissal or local-game Start, pending cap, host phrase approval. Dismissal/start/expiry erases QR pixels, code and URL from model/DOM immediately; exact revoke generation is correlated before reopen rotation. The phone accepts only exact query-free `/controller/#…`, scrubs before configuration/probes, never stores the capability and abandons redemption on scrub failure. Embedded/unsupported share or copy and duplicate reclaim reconstruct a private link only for the explicit gesture and immediate re-scrub; without capability, recovery shares exact public `/controller/` and requires a code | Old capability fails after rotation/revocation; rapid dismiss/reopen cannot revive a stale generation, hidden/expired/revoked secrets do not remain visible, malformed/scrub-denied links make no redeem request, and share/copy/reclaim never substitute an incidental already-clean URL |
| Phone Party response/state poisoning | Create/rotate responses use a ten-second deadline, 16 KiB decompressed streaming ceiling, fatal UTF-8 and exact same-origin controller URL/schema; host/controller sockets enforce 64 KiB UTF-8, exact public state, monotonic transition and same-transition fingerprint. Five-attempt generation-guarded reconnect rejects stale callbacks and requires 30 stable seconds to reset | Missing/false length, chunked overflow, invalid UTF-8/JSON, unknown/impossible fields, state regression/equivocation, thrown construction/listener/send and superseded callbacks fail closed without held input, unbounded retry or secret replacement |
| Oversized/corrupt/ambiguous service request | Every JSON/raw proxy body streams into a fixed 16/64 KiB ceiling, cancels on overflow, rejects invalid `Content-Length`, requires `application/json`, decodes fatal UTF-8 and admits only object-shaped JSON. Public Phone Party and MatchRoom actions plus nested compatibility use exact per-action key sets | Missing/wrong media type, missing/false length, chunked overflow, malformed UTF-8, primitive/array roots and unknown top-level/nested fields reject before unbounded allocation, persistence or authority mutation |
| Phone Party rotate publication race | The request captures predecessor generation G; any public generation change first erases displayed secret custody, and a response may install only G+1 while current authority is G or the already-published G+1 | Socket-before-HTTP order succeeds without accepting a secret after a later/second-host revoke or rotate, retaining an old QR under new authority, or attaching it to an unrelated generation |
| Post-commit socket failure | PartyRoom and MatchRoom persist authority before best-effort publication; socket setup, send, close, attachment decode/update and invalid recipient attachments are contained independently | A stale hibernated socket throwing during setup, state, command-result or targeted signaling delivery cannot convert a committed command into an apparent failure, block another peer, or disclose signaling |
| Phone Party cross-transport race | Native host commands have a local order and execute inside the same object-wide input gate as HTTP mutations across budget/directory/storage awaits | Concurrent native/HTTP approve, revoke, rotate or close cannot both commit from one predecessor or overwrite newer authority |
| Match invite theft/replay | 128-bit fragment secret, ten-minute service expiry capped by the room deadline, invite-only scope and leader-only generation-checked rotation; launcher custody expires receipt-relative up to 5%/30 s early, destroys secret/DOM state on generation/leadership/phase/terminal change and never copies request values into diagnostics; delayed HTTP state cannot roll back a newer socket publication and may restore a secret only for the exact generation correlated to the active rotation while that generation is current and local leader custody still holds; each join receives a distinct endpoint bearer | Old link/code, clock skew, near-room-expiry rotation, local timer and response replay after expiry, nonleader rotation, stale concurrent rotation, membership/rotation response races, mixed-version equivocation, terminal recovery and diagnostic inspection fail without exposing or reviving the secret or changing joined peers |
| Local source collision | Host-selected numbered seat, visible replacement label, generation-checked router lease; a reconnecting approved phone remains reserved and neutral | Keyboard/touch/gamepad cannot silently take over or share a phone-owned kart |
| Wrong/stale Phone Party removal | Per-seat native confirmation names the phone/seat and defaults to Keep; cancel sends no request. The room atomically closes only the exact approved controller, clears its seat, publishes the host state and targeted terminal phone state, then closes that controller's signaling socket. Either terminal signal stops phone retry. Launcher focus survives success or another-host removal | Removing one of two phones leaves the other lease/socket intact; the target receives closed/neutral copy and `seat_reclaimed`, a dropped state frame cannot create a reconnect loop, stale confirmation auto-closes, and cancel is non-mutating |
| Misleading controller name | Phone and service NFC-normalize, strip C0/C1, zero-width and bidi-isolate/override controls before a 24-code-point cap; host publications independently reject them and render only `textContent` | A phone cannot reorder or conceal the identity/phrase/seat approval row with markup or directional formatting |
| Fallback-code guessing | Short TTL, purpose-isolated directory, pseudonymous requester rate limit, global admission ceiling, pending cap 8 and uniform rejection copy | Exhaustion never evicts approved controllers |
| Match command forgery/replay | 256-bit endpoint bearer contains 128-bit nonce + 128-bit room/role HMAC; Worker rejects forgery before reserve/object access, object stores a full purpose-HMAC digest and injects actor; exact revision, monotonic command id and eight-receipt window | Wrong/cross-room bearer consumes zero control units; cross-seat action, stale concurrent command and conflicting same-id replay cannot mutate |
| Oversized/corrupt room publication | State sockets reject UTF-8 above 64 KiB; HTTP state uses the same decompressed-byte ceiling through a streaming reader, cancels before parsing overflow, and the exact immutable schema rejects malformed UTF-8/JSON and unknown fields. A poisoned subscription is closed and Retry refreshes before reconnect; a local subscription generation rejects late state/close callbacks. Synchronous adapter/native construction failure and invalid adapter handles are contained, invalidated and charged to the same finite reconnect sequence | Missing/false/large `Content-Length`, chunked overflow, invalid UTF-8/JSON, oversized socket messages, thrown setup, invalid handles and superseded callbacks cannot reach projection, schedule an unbounded reconnect path or cause unbounded control-state allocation |
| QR leaks in HTTP/referrer/log/storage | Secret is an exact same-origin `/room/#match=<43 base64url>` fragment; alternate origins/paths, credentials, query/extra/encoded fragment fields and odd code whitespace reject before I/O. The role page uses a fragment-only same-origin redirect; the always-loaded launcher captures only exact syntax into closure memory and calls `history.replaceState` before configuration/policy/model/ROM/network work. Session/local storage are forbidden; a disabled build destroys the secret and shows local recovery, while enabled pre-ROM custody is capped at ten minutes. Either scrub failure clean-navigates and abandons redemption. `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`; production creates no test recorder and loopback diagnostics retain field names only | Invalid, scrub-denied and disabled-release deep links leave an empty hash, no web-storage entry, no `/api/` request and accurate recovery; valid enabled handoff produces one join and no retained capability |
| Pending-device flood | Eight pending, four approved, bounded body/SDP, per-room transition budget | Ninth pending gets typed refusal |
| Role/port forgery | Host assigns generation-checked `PadRouter` lease; state packets carry no port | Competing P1 claim and stale release reject |
| Stale/replayed input | DTLS peer binding, connection epoch, modulo sequence window, dedupe | Old epoch/current sequence reject |
| Match source impersonation / nonce reuse | Direction-specific P-256 ECDH/HKDF-SHA-256 key binds transcript, epoch, source/recipient ids and both connection generations; the opener requires the complete caller-expected direction before AES-256-GCM authenticates the route header, input/preflight payload type and fixed 64-byte payload. Callers cannot supply the nonce sequence: one fresh direction-bound seal window owns it across both payload types, native reinitialization and a mismatched/second browser window for one direction-retaining key object refuse, browser state is read-only/concurrency-latched, and exhaustion requires rekey/reconnect | A valid peer key with a forged source id/generation, reverse key, wrong destination generation, cross-type substitution and every one-byte envelope mutation fail before plaintext/replay mutation; reordered delivery, direction mismatch/duplicate initialization, provider failure, concurrent seal, corrupt state and `UINT64_MAX` exhaustion preserve monotonic/fail-atomic custody |
| Malicious one-hop forwarding | Only mutual reachability is routable; direct wins, otherwise one deterministic lowest-id intermediate; the separately authenticated immediate DataChannel endpoint and generation must equal the header source, and a generation-bound 64-sequence window forwards unchanged ciphertext once | Asymmetric edge, stale-channel fresh-generation claim, alternate intermediary, direct-path replacement, generation reset, duplicate/old sequence and diameter-three chain refuse without fanout |
| Preflight spoof/downgrade | A fixed 124-byte report travels as three sequence-bound payload-type-1 AEAD fragments over the reliable endpoint-authenticated pairwise/one-hop path and binds the exact launch-descriptor SHA-256, peer-key transcript, order-independent directed graph, epoch and connection generation; reassembly is bound to one authenticated source-to-recipient direction and report submission compares the embedded identity with separately authenticated custody; monotonic sequences permit readiness withdrawal while same-sequence changes conflict | Native/browser report and fragment vectors, cross-source splicing/forged-attribution controls, malformed/reordered/duplicate/stale/conflicting fragments, unknown/stale identity, descriptor/transcript/graph disagreement, reordered equivalence, corruption and route-loss negatives fail closed before engine authority; service/forwarder state cannot author consensus or equivocate about routes |
| Match signaling spoof/replay | A distinct room-bound socket assigns the connection generation, injects sender id/generation, permits one socket per member, targets one exact current peer generation and accepts only monotonic exact hello/SDP/ICE/end schemas; state sockets remain read-only. Failed state/signal delivery closes only the broken socket; a replacement becomes authoritative only after welcome delivery and durable generation commit | Cross-room/wrong-protocol, client sender field, self/stale target, replay, hibernation, send/close failure and replacement-race tests fail without relay fanout, lobby mutation, false command failure or eviction of a still-authoritative predecessor |
| Match signaling MITM | Ephemeral P-256 keys are bound into one sorted room/build/ROM/epoch/generation transcript; every display compares the same 30-bit, three-compound phrase before preflight can attest confirmation | Native/browser exact vector; key/order/generation mutations change the digest, and an invalid key cannot bypass validation by sorting |
| Malformed packet | 64-byte cap, atomic codec, strict version/type/flags/length/ranges/checksum | Every one-bit vector mutation rejects unchanged output |
| Held input on loss | Hidden/pagehide/channel loss sends neutral; host 250 ms timeout; overflow becomes neutral | Timeout/overflow each emit one neutral edge |
| Duplicate controller tab | An exclusive Web Lock is paired with a same-origin broadcast takeover message; the prior tab publishes neutral, closes direct/signaling transports and releases before the new tab navigates/redeems. Web Lock rejection fails closed rather than falling through. Without Web Locks, a broadcast election plus short hashed localStorage heartbeat coordinates the same explicit release; only a 96-bit capability digest prefix, random tab id and expiry cross tabs/storage. Server-seat replacement remains host-visible removal plus approval, never an implicit credential transfer | Two live tabs never publish one local controller epoch; an old/unreachable client makes takeover refuse, and neither raw capability nor controller credential enters the tab lease |
| Party origin/TLS misconfiguration | Worker startup handling accepts only one canonical HTTPS `PARTY_ORIGIN`, with HTTP limited to loopback development, before origin exceptions, capability URL construction or Durable Object access. Host/controller clients require a trustworthy same-origin API and exact controller URL; insecure phone entry offers an explicit same-host HTTPS navigation while retaining the fragment only in closure memory | HTTP production, trailing slash/path/query/fragment/userinfo, cross-origin service metadata and malformed schemes fail without pairing or minting a bearer URL |
| Back-forward/frozen page resurrection | Phone `pagehide` clears capability, aborts redemption, publishes neutral, closes transports and releases tab ownership; tab acquisition and redemption completion recheck lifecycle state, and persisted restore reloads a fresh public controller document. `freeze` neutralizes before suspension, and resume re-arms only a connected phase after deleting old edge history and sending fresh neutral. Host `pagehide` erases QR/code/URL model and pixels, aborts page-bound create/rotate work, invalidates its operation generation, closes signaling/direct peers and clears remote pads; persisted restore reconnects only retained room/host authority and requires a new invite | Back navigation or a late lock/HTTP response cannot revive a bearer URL, credential-derived UI, dead input surface, stale QR, direct publisher, reserved pad packet or stopped reconnect/countdown loop; resume cannot replay a pre-freeze press/release edge |
| Malicious SDP/control/socket body | Phone signaling is rebuilt from exact role-specific envelopes: exact `{type,sdp}`, declared bounded ICE fields, positive generation and attachment-injected controller identity; null/array/primitive/unknown fields never relay. Native host commands have exact per-action shapes. HTTP JSON requires the correct media type at the Worker edge, including Match commands. State-only MatchRoom sockets byte-count UTF-8 and binary messages against a 4 KiB cap before their mandatory close | 1 MiB request rejects before parse/storage; wrong media type, unknown/nested signaling fields, non-object roots and over-cap text/binary frames reject or close without relay, reserve or authority mutation |
| Phone Party signaling MITM | HTTPS/HSTS plus DTLS fingerprints; 20-bit, two-compound-word pairing phrase whose transcript binds both endpoints' canonical DTLS certificate fingerprints alongside room and key identities, derived only once both WebRTC descriptions are set and compared on both screens after the phone connects; a missing, malformed or disagreeing fingerprint derives no phrase at all, and a disconnect clears the words the ended channel earned | Substituted transcript or either fingerprint moves the phrase; native and page pin identical fixture vectors including the swapped-fingerprint order; refusal shapes (absent/malformed/conflicting fingerprint lines) and the refused-reconnect path each show no words rather than stale ones |
| Cross-controller signaling disclosure | The room object resolves host `to` against each authenticated controller socket attachment and delivers an offer/ICE message only to that exact controller id; phone clients also require their own target and current peer generation | A two-controller relay fixture receives the addressed offer on one socket and none on the other; stale/wrong-target candidates cannot reach a peer connection |
| Native bootstrap impersonation | Originless native create requires exactly two version protocols plus one syntactically valid P-256 key; browser Origins are forbidden. Bootstrap is injected internally once, reconnect requires a room/role-bound 256-bit credential, and the object stores only its purpose-HMAC digest | Browser-origin, malformed-key, bootstrap-smuggling, wrong-room and forged reconnect negatives reject before room authority |
| Native TLS downgrade/trust-store drift | WSS requires certificate-chain and hostname verification against a dated, hash-pinned Mozilla extract; no insecure mode or implicit machine/Homebrew trust dependency. A hash-pinned MPL source patch keeps libdatachannel's Mbed TLS `VerifiedTlsTransport` active with that explicit CA on Windows instead of its upstream backend-agnostic fail-open branch. CA/library/patch updates require reviewed pin, notice and transport-vector changes | Build fails on archive/tag/patch/CA drift; clean MinGW compiles the patched branch; invalid chain/hostname cannot open the signaling socket |
| Peer IP disclosure | State clearly that direct WebRTC reveals peer network addresses; offer future relay-only privacy mode when capacity exists | Consent copy and mode telemetry contain no address |
| Relay observation | Direct WebRTC DTLS; any future WebSocket fallback adds reviewed end-to-end AEAD with transcript binding and erased keys | Relay fixture cannot decrypt or substitute frames |
| Quota/cost exhaustion | Separate pairing/control/relay reserves, fixed ceilings, kill switch, no billing method, fail closed with `service_budget_safe`; socket upgrades reserve their bounded message lifetime and each successful native host mutation/rotation reserves its additional fanout; room-state reconnect uses at most five automatic backoff attempts and requires 30 stable seconds before resetting; one free `/api/`-only edge rule brakes single-IP floods before Worker invocation | Admitted work, repeated rotation, socket flapping and valid-credential floods cannot consume the internal close/control reserve indefinitely; literal zero refuses first admission; static local routes do not match edge policy |
| Operations snapshot theft/abuse | Separate 256-bit-class bearer, same-origin check, constant-time comparison, absent-secret 404, no-store aggregate-only capacity/health schemas; unauthorized traffic never reads the budget object. Fixed operation buckets piggyback accepted writes, refuse mismatched v1 labels/weights and isolate legacy traffic without per-event labels or refusal-write amplification | Missing/wrong secret rejects; fixture payload contains no room, code, capability, credential, name or address canary; tracked units exactly reconstruct admitted units after restart/flood |
| Worker/Durable Object deploy skew | Versioned internal envelope; additive legacy+v1 readers; unknown version rejected before parse/storage; schema changes use expand/drain/emit/contract releases | 16-call source census, four boundary negatives, legacy direct-object and v1 full-Worker suites |
| Fabricated/incomplete $0 evidence | Exact size-bounded seven-day schema re-runs provider reconciliation—including the independent Durable Object duration ceiling—and health weights, requires contiguous UTC dates, commit/deployment digests, local-play probes, closed incidents and daily/final GO; diagnostics never reflect input | Missing/skewed day or duration, charge, partial tracking, open incident, false probe, schema canary and oversized-ledger negatives stop |
| XSS/supply chain | Dedicated origin, no user HTML, same-origin pinned assets, deny-default CSP, Trusted Types where supported, lockfile/license audit | Header and public-asset gates |
| Native callback/packet exhaustion | Transport callbacks enqueue only into bounded process-owned queues; signaling queue overflow fails the room, pad queue overflow revokes custody, state is capped at 64 bytes, MatchRoom inbound frames at 4 KiB and control/SDP at 16/64 KiB | Queue saturation and oversized payloads become typed failure/neutral rather than unbounded allocation, latency or held input |
| Service compromise | Store keyed credential digests, minimum room metadata, no packet/SDP history, ≤24 h room TTL enforced on request and by alarm | Storage snapshot/data map audit |
| LAN plain-HTTP page integrity | Local play serves the controller page over plain `http` on the LAN by owner decision (certificates are off the product path), so the transport cannot authenticate the page's bytes. This is a deliberate trust of the host's own network — the trust level of a printer or router `http` admin page — not a defended boundary; the honest claim lives in the LAN-mode section below and must not be overstated. The properties that still hold fail-closed: the page trusts only the origin that served it (`default-src 'self'`, no cross-origin fetch); `/party-ws` upgrades only for a Host in the machine's own loopback + IPv4 allowlist, so an internet page that rebinds its name to this machine's LAN IP is refused at the upgrade even though it reaches the port; an upgraded socket is anonymous and does nothing until it redeems a valid capability or code; the six-digit fallback throttles on one shared guess bucket (correct on a LAN, where a per-IP bucket is defeated by a single NAT); refusals reflect nothing | The zero-internet E2E lane serves the page from a real non-loopback IPv4, proves `isSecureContext === false` (no `crypto.subtle`), redeems over `/party-ws` and pairs with the pure-JS SAS v2 twin over real libdatachannel DTLS with no Worker in the path; the Host-allowlist/DNS-rebinding refusal, the anonymous-until-redeem close and the single-bucket code throttle each reject their negatives |

## LAN mode (local play, no internet)

Local play runs the whole pairing and gameplay path on one LAN with no cloud
Worker, no account and no internet: the launcher embeds the controller-page
server and an in-process room, and phones scan a QR to a plain-`http://<lan-ip>:<port>/controller/`
origin. Certificates are off the product path by owner decision, so this mode
changes the transport trust model in exactly one way. State it precisely for
players and reviewers — overclaiming here is a defect.

What local play still protects, unchanged from cloud mode:

- **The gameplay channel is encrypted end to end.** Pad input and rumble travel
  over WebRTC data channels, which are DTLS-encrypted regardless of the page
  being served over plain `http`. Serving the page insecurely does not weaken
  the pad channel; DTLS negotiates its own keys on the channel itself.
- **A matching phrase means the humans verified the channel.** The pairing
  phrase (SAS v2, `golden-balloon-party-sas-v2` transcript) commits to both
  endpoints' canonical DTLS certificate fingerprints. A relay that swaps either
  fingerprint moves the phrase, so a character-for-character match means the two
  people confirmed the pad channel was not swapped — MITM of the pad channel is
  detectable exactly as in cloud mode. Because the LAN origin is insecure the
  browser withholds `crypto.subtle`, so the page runs the pure-JS SHA-256 +
  P-256 SAS twin; the zero-internet E2E lane cross-proves that twin against the
  native Mbed TLS crypto on a real channel.
- **Fail-closed admission holds.** The page trusts only the origin that served
  it (`default-src 'self'`, no cross-origin fetch). `/party-ws` upgrades only
  for a Host in the machine's own loopback + IPv4 allowlist, so an internet page
  that rebinds its name to this machine's LAN IP is refused at the upgrade even
  though it reaches the port. An upgraded socket is anonymous and does nothing
  until it redeems a valid capability or code. The six-digit fallback is
  throttled by one shared guess bucket — correct on a LAN, where a per-IP bucket
  would be defeated by a single NAT. There is no cloud surface at all: an
  origin-less build shows the local-play card but never a cloud/online card,
  which still requires a compiled `MDKR_PARTY_ORIGIN`.

What plain-`http` local mode does **not** protect: the integrity of the
controller **page** itself. The transport cannot authenticate the page's bytes,
so a hostile device already on your LAN could serve a different page at the same
address. The honest framing is that local mode trusts your own network — the
trust level of your printer's or router's `http` admin page. This is a
deliberate, reasonable trade for zero-internet play, not a defended boundary; do
not describe local play as protecting against a compromised LAN.

The zero-internet path is proven end to end by `tests/check_party_lan_e2e.py`
(native host + embedded server + in-process room + real headless-Chromium
controller over real libdatachannel DTLS, no Worker anywhere) and the host
allowlist, anonymous-until-redeem and single-bucket throttle negatives in the
LAN room/server suites.

## Security invariants

- Never log or metric raw names, capabilities, fallback codes, credentials, IP
  addresses, SDP, DTLS fingerprints, input packets, ROM/save data or raw hashes.
- Names are plain text rendered with `textContent`, normalized and bounded; they
  never enter metric labels or protocol error text.
- Credential comparison is constant-time after keyed hashing. Keys come from
  the deployment secret store. The current schema uses drain-and-reissue key
  rotation; any future dual-key overlap requires an explicit versioned schema
  and review rather than an implicit fallback.
- Static routes never execute metered code. Credential responses use
  `Cache-Control: no-store`; controller HTML uses a restrictive CSP,
  `frame-ancestors 'none'`, nosniff, no-referrer and restrictive permissions.
- Unknown input fails closed without partial reducer/router mutation. Closing a
  room is idempotent and neutralizes controllers before releasing seats.
- No universal availability claim and no automatic paid upgrade. If free limits
  are unavailable, local play remains one click away with specific recovery.
- Durable code directories use purpose-separated HMAC keys and separate Party
  and Match shards. Neither room objects nor directory keys persist the raw
  six-digit code; storage-inspection tests enforce this boundary.
- Daily capacity shards store only bounded integer counters, thirteen fixed
  reservation counts and two refusal latches, schedule deletion after 32 days,
  and expose them only through the separate operations bearer. Operation
  metrics reuse the accepted reservation write; a refusal flood writes each
  latch at most once and increments no metric.

## Review triggers

Threat-model sign-off is required before adding a provider, relay, account,
analytics field, third-party script, new credential role, longer retention,
protocol version, public matchmaking, native WebRTC library, CA bundle date or
cryptographic build configuration. Production launch also requires
dependency/SAST/secret scans, fuzzing, rate-limit load evidence, origin/header
capture, packaged-notice verification, incident runbook rehearsal and
credential rotation proof.
