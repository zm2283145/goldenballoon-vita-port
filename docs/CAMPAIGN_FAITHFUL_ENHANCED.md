# Campaign: faithful Enhanced cadence

**Goal.** Enhanced runs the game at 60 Hz with the gameplay a player would get
on Original. Original itself does not move a single instruction. Alongside it:
code structure and repo hygiene enforced by gates rather than by intention, and
no AI-slop prose anywhere a player or a reviewer can see it.

This is the plan of record. It is written to be falsifiable: every milestone
has a gate that fails when the milestone is not met, and a positive control
that proves the gate is not vacuous.

---

## 0. What is provably impossible, stated up front

"Enhanced with zero deviation from Original" is not reachable, for three
independent reasons, each sufficient alone:

1. **RNG consumption is per-tick.** Twice the ticks is twice the draws.
   `EVENTHASH` and `SIMHASH` diverge at tick zero, not gradually — the same
   mechanism that makes `check_state_hash`'s legacy-RNG control diverge
   immediately.
2. **The integrator is nonlinear.** `velocity -= velSquare * traction` applied
   twice at half strength is not the same as once at full strength. No choice
   of scaling constant fixes this; it is a property of the arithmetic.
3. **The authored state is fixed-point.** `s16` rotations, the 2-bit UV
   accumulators, `x_rotation += angle >> 3`. Half-steps quantise differently
   and the residue accumulates with a sign rather than cancelling.

Chasing bit-identity would therefore produce a gate that can only be satisfied
by lying. The contract below is the honest one, and it is stricter where it can
be and explicit where it cannot.

**THE CONTRACT.** At authored 30 Hz tick boundaries, under Enhanced:

| stream | requirement |
|---|---|
| `EVENTHASH` | **bit-identical** to Original |
| `INPUTHASH` | **bit-identical** to Original |
| `PCM` | **bit-identical** to Original |
| `SIMHASH` | divergence bounded by a published tolerance over a full race |

Original's own streams stay bit-identical to what they are today, always. That
is not a target; it is a precondition on every commit in this campaign.

## 1. The architecture: split the tick

A DKR tick welds together two things, and only one of them resists
subdivision.

* **Discrete** — RNG draws, checkpoint crossings, item logic, AI decisions,
  timers, audio cue triggers, lap and finish events. These are events, not
  integrals. Subdividing them is meaningless, and it is what breaks the
  streams.
* **Continuous** — position and velocity integration, camera solve, animation
  phase, suspension and pitch. These are integrals over time. Subdividing them
  is what they are for.

Enhanced runs **discrete logic only on authored boundaries, in authored
order**, and **continuous integration at 60 Hz with correct dt**. That is what
makes the first three rows of the contract achievable at all.

Issue #26 is the evidence for this split. The boss was not merely moving
faster — it was *deciding* twice as often, and the wheel-0 traction hole turned
that into an unbounded runaway.

---

## 2. Milestones

### M0 — Classify every per-tick site
The ~59 `//!@Delta` markers (49 `racer.c`, 4 `object_functions.c`, 6 `menu.c`)
plus the boss start-timer constants in `vehicle_*.c` are the inventory. Each
gets one of four labels: CONTINUOUS (scale by dt), DISCRETE (gate to authored
boundary), THRESHOLD (scale the bound, as the menu auto-repeat fix does), or
INERT (equilibrium-governed or already scaled — proven, not assumed).

**Gate:** `check_delta_inventory.py` — every `//!@Delta` in the tree carries a
classification comment; an unclassified one fails. **Positive control:** adding
a bare `//!@Delta` fails the gate.

### M1 — Delta-correctness sweep
Apply the M0 classification. Additive terms take `× updateRateF * 0.5`; decays
become `k^(updateRate/2)`; thresholds scale. Removes the 2× acceleration
transients and the measured 3–8% AI lap delta.

**Gate:** extend `check_bluey2_rematch` and add an ordinary-racer arm asserting
Enhanced/Original lap-time parity within tolerance on a non-boss track.
**Positive control:** `MDKR_BOSS_CADENCE_COMPAT=0` still reproduces the runaway.

### M2 — Occupancy, not traction — THE PREMISE HERE WAS WRONG

**This milestone was specified on a false premise and is rewritten.** It
originally said: close the wheel-0 traction hole, because
`update_car_velocity_ground()` samples drag from `wheel_surfaces[0]` alone
while the human path averages all contacting wheels, so a boss with wheel 0
lifted keeps full thrust with zero drag. The stated gate was "boss peak
|velocity| at or under the authored governor with the clamp disabled", on the
claim that "Original sits exactly on that ceiling and never exceeds it".

**That claim is measurably false, and the data to refute it was already in
hand when the claim was written.** Measured peaks against a governor ceiling of
16.29: Bubbler 16.20, Bluey 2 **16.91** on a time-trial route and **19.09** on
the adventure route. Tracing the Original boss through its peak shows velocity
climbing at +0.6171/tick across frames with `groundedWheels` between 1 and 3 —
no drag term at all — then decaying once all four regain contact. **The
authored boss's pace USES the drag-free episode.** The wheel-0 hole is not a
bug the boss suffers; it is a mechanism the boss's speed depends on.

So closing the hole makes the boss too slow, and it was measured doing exactly
that: the traction fix took the boss from 7.0% slow to 9.4% slow and handed the
player the win. It was reverted.

**What is actually wrong under Enhanced is the OCCUPANCY of that state, not the
state itself.** Ticks spent at partial contact (1–3 wheels), Bluey 2:

| | Original | Enhanced |
|---|---|---|
| boss | 11.8% | **20.2%** (1.7x) |
| human | 15.4% | 26.9% |
| fully airborne | 10.2% | 9.8% (unchanged) |

Airtime is unchanged, so this is contact and attitude dynamics, not flight. The
boss is taking roughly twice the authored dose of drag-free thrust. No value of
the traction term fixes that: any partial drag puts the peak back over the
ceiling, and zero drag is what Original does. **Peak ≤ 16.3 and "boss pace =
Original" are mutually exclusive while occupancy is 2x** — which is why the old
gate over-constrained and could not be satisfied honestly.

**The real fix is M1-shaped:** scale the per-tick attitude and suspension terms
that put the boss into partial contact twice as often. Several carry no
`//!@Delta` marker at all — `y_rotation += temp_s16 >> 2`,
`unk10C = (unk10C * 7) >> 3`, `y_rotation_vel = (y_rotation_vel * 7) >> 3`, and
`y_rotation_vel += (gCurrentCarSteerVel - y_rotation_vel) >> 3`. The
lateral-loop rule applies: a source/sink pair must be scaled as a whole or not
at all.

**Revised gate:** partial-contact occupancy under Enhanced within tolerance of
Original on both bosses, and boss finish inside the Original band with the
clamp disabled. Occupancy is the invariant that was actually violated, so it is
what the gate should measure. **Positive control:** `MDKR_BOSS_CADENCE_COMPAT=0`
on an unfixed build still reproduces the runaway.

### M3 — The discrete/continuous split
Gate discrete call sites to authored boundaries. Large but mechanical once M0
exists.

**Gate:** `EVENTHASH`/`INPUTHASH`/`PCM` bit-identical between cadences on three
routes; `SIMHASH` divergence within the published bound.

### M4 — Input latency, measured before it is optimised
The tick quantum is the second-order term; the pipeline may dominate.
Instrument input→photon and publish the budget split before deciding whether
M3 earns its cost for latency specifically.

**Gate:** a recorded budget with a method others can re-run.

**The instrument (2026-08-10).** `platform/input_latency_census.c`, armed by
`MDKR_INPUT_LATENCY=1`, reported at shutdown as `[INPUT-LATENCY]` rows with
n/mean/p50/p95/p99/max in ms. Four terms, on the pacer's own host clock:

| term | measures |
|---|---|
| `queue` | SDL event timestamp → the pump that dispatched it. SDL2 stamps in ms, so this term is ms-resolution and no better. |
| `sample` | last host capture that fed a ticket → the commit that published it. Dead time: the sample is taken and then waits. |
| `tick` | commit → commit. The authored quantum, and the anchor the other rows are read against. |
| `present` | commit → the swap that returns for the frame that ran on that input. Simulation, list build, submit, and the block inside the swap. |

Scanout past the swap is not observable in-process. Bound it by hand from the
backend's own `[PRESENT-MODE] frameLatency=` row plus one refresh; the WebGPU
path pins `desiredMaximumFrameLatency` to 1.

**Method, re-runnable:**

```
MDKR_INPUT_LATENCY=1 MDKR_PACE_REALTIME=1 \
  ./build-rel/mdkr64 --rom baserom.us.v80.z64 2>&1 | grep INPUT-LATENCY
```

Play the run by hand to populate `queue`; `sample` is measured from ordinary
host-state captures even without an input edge. Vary `MDKR_PRESENT_RATE`
(`original`, `60`, `120`) to move the `sample` term and confirm it tracks the
present interval. **`MDKR_PACE_REALTIME=1` is not optional**: under the
synthetic pacer every wall-clock number in this census is meaningless (§0 of
`CAMPAIGN_HIGH_FPS.md`), and the config row printed with the budget records
which pacing produced it so a synthetic run cannot be misread as a real one.

**The structural result, derived from the loop and independent of the
measurement.** In `stubs_dkr.c`'s retrace branch the presentation subloop is

```
for (;;) {
    units = platform_vi_present_pace_units();   /* the wait */
    ticks_due = present_sched_advance_units(units, rebased);
    if (ticks_due != 0) break;                  /* exits with no pump */
    ... replay ...  platform_frame_sync();      /* pumps, then presents */
}
... platform_input_commit_tick(ticket);
```

Every host capture runs from `platform_input_pump`, and the pump runs from
`platform_frame_sync_impl`. In the presentation subloop, the loop breaks
straight out of the wait, so **no capture happens between the last intermediate
present and the commit**. Original takes a different path: it paces first and
then pumps the authored endpoint immediately before the commit. The measured
shape follows that control flow:

| presentation | `sample`, structurally |
|---|---|
| Frame limit Original (30 Hz) | census floor, ~0.1 ms — pump follows the pacing wait |
| 60 Hz | ~16.7 ms |
| 120 Hz | ~8.3 ms |

**The reducible term is material specifically when the presentation subloop is
active.** At 60 Hz it is almost one display interval; at Original it is already
gone. `present` remains bounded by the backend queue and scanout, with WebGPU's
`frameLatency` pinned to 1.

**M3 does not earn its cost for latency.** At Interpolated 60 Hz, late sampling
removes the measured ~16 ms accidental wait without changing authoritative
cadence or simulation state. Latency therefore does not justify changing the
gameplay tick rate.

**Implemented: `platform_input_sample_late()`** (default on;
`MDKR_INPUT_JIT=0` is the diagnostic opt-out), called at the tick boundary
immediately before the commit. It reruns the
same event dispatch and the same capture through the same
`present_sched_input_target_tick()` accessor, so it adds host captures — which
the bounded queue already accepts in unbounded number per tick and coalesces —
and adds no ticket, no consume and no controller read. The DKR-visible contract
is one published pad sample per authored tick, unchanged.

**Default-on evidence (2026-08-12, same Mac/ProMotion host):** at the shipped
Interpolated/display policy resolving to 60 Hz, the `sample` p50 fell from
16.1 ms to the census floor of 0.1 ms (p99 17.3 ms to 0.1 ms). Original was
already at the 0.1 ms floor because its pump occurs after the authored pacing
wait, so the extra sample is intentionally redundant there. The arbitrary-rate
gate runs its 60 Hz scripted arm both ways and requires the state, ordered-event,
consumed-input and PCM streams to remain byte-identical; scripted inputs are
time-independent, so any divergence proves the change touched processing rather
than timing.

## 3. Code quality gates

These are lessons this repo has already paid for. Each becomes a gate so the
lesson does not have to be re-learned.

1. **Cadence gating keys on launch-time cadence, never on `updateRate`.** Under
   Original a lag tick legitimately arrives with `updateRate` 3 or more, and
   the authored code must handle it byte-identically. A grep gate rejects
   `updateRate == 1` / `updateRate == 2` used as a mode test.
2. **Every behavioural fix ships a positive control that fails without it.**
   `check_bluey2_rematch` sat green for months while asserting the defect it
   was written to catch. A gate with no failing control is a gate with no
   evidence.
3. **No `git add -A`.** This campaign already produced one commit whose message
   described three renderer fixes while the commit also contained an unreviewed
   launcher redesign and a gameplay change. Stage explicit paths.
4. **A root cause is not closed until its class is swept.** #25 and #27 were the
   same function failing to save borrowed state; sweeping that class found two
   more defects nobody had reported.
5. **Parallel work is scoped by INVARIANT, not by file.** Two agents were
   given disjoint file scopes — `racer.c` versus `vehicle_*.c` — and still
   collided, because the boss countdowns read `gRaceStartTimer`, which
   `racer.c` owns, and because both were graded by the same gate. Disjoint
   files are not disjoint state. Before parallelising, ask what shared
   invariant the pieces are both standing on; if they share one, serialise
   them. Corollary already paid for: never run the suite while anything is
   editing the tree it measures.
6. **A measurement is not believed until its subject is confirmed.**
   `MDKR_LOAD_TRACK` only binds once the route reaches track select; a short run
   silently races a default level. Confirm via `[TRACE] level_light: level=N`.
   This cost three wrong measurements in one day.

## 4. Prose quality

**The rule:** anything a player or a reviewer reads should sound like a game
developer wrote it — short, concrete, specific. No process vocabulary in
player-facing text. No sentence whose purpose is to sound thorough.

Banned in player-facing strings: *seamlessly, leverage, ensure, robust, enhance
your experience, comprehensive, authored presentation states, safe frame
boundary, durable storage, compatibility mode*. Release notes are for players:
no validation or process words.

**Structural finding to fix first:** player-facing strings are pinned by
contract tests across `CMakeLists.txt`, `macos/Scripts/verify_unsigned_release.sh`
and `tests/ci_contract_manifest.py`, so improving one sentence is a five-file
change. That is *why* the slop survived. The pinning should assert the claims
that matter (no false product claims) rather than exact prose.

**Gate:** `check_player_prose.py` — banned vocabulary in player-facing strings
and release notes fails. **Positive control:** a seeded "seamlessly" fails.
