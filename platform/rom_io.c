/**
 * rom_io.c — load baserom.us.v80.z64 into memory and serve DMA from it.
 *
 * DKR accesses cart data via osPiStartDma; on native every DMA becomes a memcpy
 * out of this in-memory image (see stubs_dkr.c osPiStartDma). The ROM bytes are
 * kept as raw big-endian .z64 bytes — per-asset byteswap is a separate later
 * workstream and is NOT done here.
 *
 * The load gate runs in this order, and the order matters:
 *
 *   1. SIZE      — 12 MB exactly (order-independent, so it can come first and
 *                  gives the clearest message for "wrong game / truncated").
 *   2. BYTE ORDER — a .v64/.n64 image is converted IN PLACE to .z64 order here,
 *                  before anything reads a single field. Accepting a byteswapped
 *                  image without converting it would be worse than rejecting it:
 *                  the engine would read every asset through a transposition and
 *                  produce silent garbage. Byte-order parity is locked by
 *                  tests/check_rom_revision.py.
 *   3. REVISION  — which DKR is this? See rom_id.c. Size + magic + "the title
 *                  contains 'diddy'" is true of ALL FIVE DKR revisions, so the
 *                  old gate let a European or Japanese cart straight through into
 *                  a boot that read its asset table from the wrong ROM offset.
