/**
 * mdkr_adventure.c -- Adventure-mode TEST HOOKS (native port only).
 *
 * Every hook here is a no-op unless its environment variable is set -- the same
 * contract as MDKR_FORCE_BOOST / MDKR_FORCE_LAPS / MDKR_AUTOPILOT /
 * MDKR_LOAD_TRACK. The driving hook is called at the end of
 * update_player_racer()'s input dispatch; the result-verdict hook is called
 * after natural finish assignment in race_check_finish().
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Timber's Island (ASSET_LEVEL_CENTRALAREAHUB) was drivable but no headless run
 * had ever ENTERED a race from it.  Entering one means driving through a
 * BHV_EXIT object: obj_loop_exit() latches racer->exitObj, racer_enter_door()
 * then drives the last stretch and calls set_level_transition_from_exit_entry()
 * (func_8006D968) on the exit's level_entry.  Two properties make that unreachable by scripted input:
 *
 *   - it is a point target: the exit only latches inside its activation radius
 *     AND on the correct side of its facing plane
 *     (dot(dir, racer - exit) < 0, obj_loop_exit), and
 *   - MDKR_AUTOPILOT=1 follows the hub's AI-node spline, which stays in the
 *     central beach loop -- measured bounding box x -1633..1761, z -1699..2025
 *     over 6133 frames (cp 66, lap 6), whose closest approach to ANY hub exit is
 *     2144 units.  It laps the island forever without ever turning in at a door.
 *
 * 18 hand-timed open-loop stick routes had already failed (docs/OPEN_ITEMS.md
 * "P3.5 Adventure").  The missing capability is closed-loop steering toward a
 * known object, which is what this provides.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The hooks
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   MDKR_OBJDUMP=1   (=2 also dumps every AI node and its adjacency)
 *       Once per level, print every BHV_EXIT, BHV_DOOR/BHV_TT_DOOR,
 *       BHV_GOLDEN_BALLOON and dialogue NPC with its world position and the
 *       fields that decide whether the player may pass.  Everything is read from
 *       the live spawned object plus its on-disk level_entry, so a mis-decoded
 *       object map shows up here as nonsense rather than as an unexplained
 *       failure to enter.  This is how every object id in the route fixtures was
 *       found -- no offline object-map parser to disagree with the game.
 *
 *   MDKR_DRIVE_ROUTE="<levelId>:<step>[:<step>...][;<levelId>:...]"
 *       Steer the human racer through an ordered list of steps, per level.
 *       Levels not named are left completely alone, so MDKR_AUTOPILOT=1 can
 *       drive the race itself.  Steps:
 *
 *         E<destMapId>   the BHV_EXIT whose LevelObjectEntry_Exit
 *                        .destinationMapId is <destMapId>.  Names the level you
 *                        want to ENTER rather than a coordinate, and takes the
 *                        position from the object the game actually spawned.
 *                        Retires when the level actually changes while it is the
 *                        active step, which is the only observable "this exit was
 *                        used".
 *         B<balloonID>   the BHV_GOLDEN_BALLOON with that balloonID.  Completes
 *                        only when the balloon is really COLLECTED, i.e. when
 *                        courseFlagsPtr[courseId] gains bit (0x10000 <<
 *                        balloonID) -- the same flag obj_loop_goldenballoon
 *                        sets.  A proximity test would not do: collection needs
 *                        interactObj->distance < 45 (a 3D distance), so
 *                        "close enough to steer past" is not "collected".
 *         T              the BHV_TROPHY_CABINET in the current world lobby.
 *                        The step deliberately has no proximity completion:
 *                        only the cabinet's production collision/dialogue path
 *                        can enter the trophy series.
 *         <x>,<z>        a plain waypoint, completed within MDKR_DRIVE_WPR
 *                        units (default 220).
 *         R<frames>      REVERSE for <frames> update-rate units (B button, stick
 *                        back, steering mirrored so the nose swings toward the
 *                        NEXT point step while the kart backs off the obstacle).
 *         H<frames>      hold the BRAKE for <frames> update-rate units, steering
 *                        nothing; retires on the count, not on a position.
 *
 *       R and H are the escape primitives. Every other step drives forward, so
 *       before them a route could not express "try to get out of this" -- the
 *       only route to mdkr_adv_steer()'s reverse argument was the automatic
 *       stall heuristic. That gap is why a wedge was unassertable: a kart
 *       standing still with the throttle held into a shut door is CORRECT, and
 *       only a commanded escape attempt separates it from one that cannot leave.
 *       Existing routes are unaffected -- a bare `x,z` still parses as a plain
 *       waypoint and no old route contains an R or H step.
 *
 *       Steps complete in order, are never revisited, and PERSIST per level
 *       across leaving and re-entering it.  That is what lets one route both
 *       enter a race from the world lobby and, on the way back out, leave the
 *       lobby for Timber's Island -- and it means the route cannot oscillate
 *       between two steps.
 *
 *   MDKR_DRIVE_WPR=<units>       waypoint completion radius (default 220)
 *   MDKR_DRIVE_VERBOSE=1         per-30-frame progress trace (needs MDKR_TRACE)
 *
 *   MDKR_BOSS_ROUTE=1
 *       Preserve the stock Tricky 1 AI line through checkpoint 35, then steer
 *       toward a point beyond the summit finish from checkpoint 36 onward. The
 *       kart still uses production physics, terrain and object collision and
 *       must set raceFinished by crossing the real finish plane. This is the
 *       closed-loop route primitive for tests/check_first_boss_progression.py,
 *       not a result or progression shortcut.
 *
 *   MDKR_SILVER_ROUTE=1
 *       Steer toward the nearest silver coin this player has not collected, when
 *       one is within MDKR_SILVER_RADIUS (default 1400) units; otherwise leave
 *       the AI line alone. The same shape as MDKR_BOSS_ROUTE and for the same
 *       reason: DKR places silver coins off the racing line on purpose, so the
 *       stock AI collects 5-6 of 8 (measured, Ancient Lake, three laps) and
 *       set_course_finish_flags()'s `silverCoinCount >= 8` write can never be
 *       observed. Steering only -- it never touches silverCoinCount or the coin
 *       objects, so a coin still counts only when obj_loop_silvercoin() sees its
 *       own interactObj->distance < 80. The radius is what keeps the detour
 *       local: divert at any range and the kart stops making checkpoint
 *       progress, so it never finishes and nothing is written at all.
 *       Used by tests/check_campaign_progression.py.
 *
 *   MDKR_SILVER_RADIUS=<units>   silver-coin detour range (default 1400)
 *
 *   MDKR_AUTOPILOT_UNSTICK=1
 *       Re-arm DKR's OWN stuck-recovery for the MDKR_AUTOPILOT racer when that
 *       recovery has become unreachable. racer_AI_pathing_inputs() reverses a
 *       stopped kart out of an obstacle (unk213 counts up to 60 while stopped,
 *       then unk214=60 kicks in reverse and unk1CA picks another AI line), but
 *       the whole block is gated on a cooldown, unk215, that is ONLY decremented
 *       while `velocity < -0.5`, i.e. while the kart is driving forwards. A kart
 *       that comes to rest with a hot cooldown therefore never re-arms: measured
 *       in Hot Top Volcano, unk215 froze at 94 and the kart sat at
 *       (-2139.4, -120.7, 1498.9) with three wheels grounded and A held for
 *       18,677 frames. That is upstream behaviour (identical in the decomp at
 *       the recorded baseline), not a port defect, so it is not changed for
 *       production; this hook only zeroes the cooldown after the autopilot kart
 *       is PROVABLY immobile (moved < 1 unit while 120 update-rate units elapse
 *       -- 60 frames -- grounded, racing and with input not blocked) and lets
 *       the game's own recovery do the driving. It never
 *       moves the kart, steers it, touches collision, laps, raceFinished or any
 *       verdict, and it is off unless asked for -- the deliberately broken
 *       collision-grid control in tests/check_first_boss_progression.py does not
 *       set it and so still fails to finish.
 *
 *   MDKR_ADVENTURE_WIN=1
 *       After controller port 1 has NATURALLY completed every lap of a default
 *       race, rotate its already-assigned finishing place to first. This is a
 *       verdict control for the Adventure persistence check, not a driving or
 *       finish shortcut: it cannot change lap, raceFinished, clock, position,
 *       physics, or any unfinished racer. The old positions remain a valid
 *       permutation (1..N), so the production finishing-order code is exercised
 *       exactly as it is for a real win.
 *
 *   MDKR_ADVENTURE_LOSS=1
 *       After the same natural finish, require a non-winning place. This is the
 *       symmetric control for builds whose instrumented racer naturally wins.
 *       If the human is first, a computer racer receives first and the human
 *       receives second; otherwise no order changes.
 *
 *   MDKR_TROPHY_ORDER="<racer ids in finish order>[/...]"
 *       At each production trophy rankings init, replace the already-complete
 *       race order with the corresponding validated permutation. Example:
 *       "0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7/1,0,2,3,4,5,6,7" makes racer 0 win round one and
 *       racer 1 win round two. This does not finish a racer and cannot write
 *       points, rankings, cinematics, trophies, or save data; all of those
 *       remain the work of menu_trophy_race_rankings_*.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Three things a route author must know (each cost real debugging time)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 1. Doors need balloons, and the canonical route collects one.
 *    obj_loop_door() only opens on `courseFlagsPtr[courseId] & (0x10000 <<
 *    doorID)`, which it sets from `*settings->balloonsPtr >=
 *    door->balloonCount`.  Measured requirements: the hub's Dino Domain doors 1,
 *    Snowflake Mountain 2, Sherbet Island 10, Dragon Forest 16; in the Dino
 *    Domain lobby, Ancient Lake 1, Fossil Canyon 2, Jungle Falls 3, Hot Top
 *    Volcano 5, the boss doors 4 (local).  Of the hub's seven balloons only the
 *    four with challengeID == 0 are collectable: obj_init_goldenballoon() sets
 *    properties.goldenBalloon.action = 1 for a challenge balloon whose tajFlag
 *    is unset, and obj_loop_goldenballoon()'s collect branch is gated on
 *    action == 0.
 *
 *    CAVEAT, and do not rely on the opposite: an exit can be latched in FRONT of
 *    a closed door.  obj_loop_exit()'s half-plane boundary
 *    (dot(dir, racer - exit) == 0) does not coincide with the door line, and the
 *    activation radius is large (253 for the hub's Dino Domain exit, 191 for the
 *    lobby's Ancient Lake exit), so a corner exists on the near side where the
 *    test passes.  Measured: with `MDKR_DRIVE_ROUTE="0:200,500:-1004,946:E12;12:E5"`
 *    and NO balloon collected, the kart reaches the Dino Domain lobby at frame
 *    6582 and Ancient Lake at 6884 with balloons_total=0 and both relevant doors
 *    reporting open=0.  Whether real hardware allows the same corner is NOT
 *    verified here -- see docs/OPEN_ITEMS.md.  The committed route collects
 *    balloon 10 anyway, precisely so that the doors really are open (verified:
 *    the lobby's Ancient Lake door reports open=1) and the route exercises the
 *    intended path rather than the corner.
 *
 * 2. Do not bump the dialogue NPCs.  Taj (BHV_PARK_WARDEN, behaviourId 62) sits
 *    at (-197, 255, 193) in the hub and T.T. (BHV_STOPWATCH_MAN, 31) at
 *    (-9, -52, -561) in the Dino Domain lobby.  Both open a dialogue on physical
 *    contact (obj_loop_parkwarden / obj_loop_stopwatchman: INTERACT_FLAGS_PUSHING
 *    within 300 units, or Z) and then call disable_racer_input() every frame it
 *    is open, which zeroes the racer's velocity from inside update_player_racer.
 *    This hook cannot rescue that: the dialogue is advanced by input_pressed()
 *    read straight off the pad, NOT by the gCurrent* globals written here, and
 *    update_player_racer zeroes gCurrentButtonsPressed anyway whenever
 *    gRacerInputBlocked is set.  Measured: a straight line from the hub spawn to
 *    the Dino Domain exit drives into Taj and freezes at (-125.3, 149.6) with
 *    gRacerInputBlocked = 1 for 3000+ frames.  Route around them; MDKR_OBJDUMP
 *    prints where they are.
 *
 * 3. The AI-node graph is NOT a navmesh -- do not try to path-find on it.  The
 *    hub has 21 BHV_AINODE objects (MDKR_OBJDUMP=2) and they form SEVEN
 *    disconnected components: one 9-node loop on the central beach, plus a
 *    3-node triangle around each wandering object.  There is no node path from
 *    the spawn to any door, which is also why MDKR_AUTOPILOT can only lap the
 *    beach.  Cross-island travel has to be expressed as explicit waypoints; the
 *    ones in tests/check_adventure_race_loop.py are sampled from the [PACE]
 *    trace of the pre-existing open-loop hub fixture, i.e. from ground the port
 *    has already been observed to drive.

 * A kart that stops with a hot cooldown can therefore never satisfy the gate

 * production simulation is left alone and this test hook zeroes the cooldown
 * only after the kart is provably immobile. Everything after that is the game's
 * own code: unk213 accumulates, unk214 kicks the reverse, unk1CA picks another
 * AI line. This never writes a position, a lap, raceFinished or a verdict.
 *
 * Off unless MDKR_AUTOPILOT_UNSTICK is set, so no other fixture's trajectory can

 * was a property enforced by ONE check's assertion
 * (tests/check_first_boss_progression.py's `off_course` block) rather than by
 * the hook, while tests/check_race_multiplayer.py enables the unscoped form on
 * Ancient Lake with no equivalent assertion. Scoping is opt-in rather than
 * mandatory precisely because that multiplayer use is deliberate: the point is
 * that a fixture which knows where the wedge is can now say so to the guard,
 * and a new wedge site elsewhere then fails to be rescued instead of being

/* ------------------------------------------------- boss progress observation */
/*
 * Two hooks for the ONE piece of state the boss-race verdict turns on.
 *
 * racer_boss_finish() (game/src/vehicle_tricky.c) decides between "play the win
 * cutscene and award the amulet" and "just transition back" by testing
 * `settings->courseFlagsPtr[courseId] & RACE_CLEARED` -- and RACE_CLEARED on a
 * BOSS course is written in exactly one place, that same function's own win
 * branch.  So a first boss win presents correctly if and only if nothing has set
 * that bit (or the matching `settings->bosses` bit) beforehand.  Both bits are
 * written by index from several unrelated subsystems (golden balloons, doors,
 * triggers and the save unpacker all do `courseFlagsPtr[<some index>] |= ...`),
 * so "nothing sets it early" is a property that has to be MEASURED, not read:
 * one stray index and every first boss win loses its cutscene, with no crash and
 * nothing in the log.
 *
 *   MDKR_WATCH_COURSEFLAGS=<levelId>
 *       One "[BOSSW]" line per observed CHANGE to courseFlagsPtr[levelId] or to
 *       settings->bosses, with the frame and the level DKR currently considers
 *       current.  Polled at the frame boundary rather than hooked into each
 *       writer, deliberately: it therefore catches a write through a WRONG index
 *       just as well as a write through the intended one, which is the whole
 *       point.  Low bits are the race flags (1 visited, 2 cleared, 4 silver
 *       coins); bits 16+ are per-level balloon/door/trigger flags.
 *
 *   MDKR_BOSS_PRECLEARED=<levelId>
 *       Hold that boss course at "already beaten" -- courseFlagsPtr[levelId] |=
 *       RACE_VISITED|RACE_CLEARED and bosses |= 1 << world(levelId) -- which is
 *       the state a save carries once the boss has been beaten once.  This is
 *       the POSITIVE CONTROL for the above: it reproduces, from an unmodified
 *       binary, the reported "won the boss, got no cutscene and no amulet, and
 *       was dropped back in front of the boss door".  Re-applied every frame
 *       because FILE SELECT reallocates Settings and clear_game_progress() would
 *       otherwise wipe it.
 *
 *   MDKR_BOSS_WIN=1
 *       Award the HUMAN first place the instant its race finishes, by writing
 *       the one field racer_boss_finish() branches on -- racer->finishPosition.
 *
 *       This replaces MDKR_BOSS_SLOW=1 (platform/stubs_dkr.c, `velocity *= 0.15f`
 *       on the boss) in every check that needs the win branch, and the reason is
 *       the "closedloop" wave's central lesson.  Crippling the boss does not just
 *       change the boss: the human is driven by DKR's own AI, which paths
 *       relative to the field, so a crawling boss changes the HUMAN's racing line
 *       too.  Measured on Fire Mountain (boss 38) once the ROM's RNG seed, arctan
 *       table and table-based trig became the defaults: with MDKR_BOSS_SLOW the
 *       human climbs to y=4649 at frame 8700, clips the summit ledge, hangs with
 *       all four wheels off the ground (`[GRND] gw=0`, pitch ramping 3317 ->
 *       4133) for 84 frames and never crosses the line -- racer_boss_finish() is
 *       never reached at all, at any budget, so the whole win assertion goes
 *       vacuous.  The same route WITHOUT the slowdown finishes reliably in every
 *       arm measured (y=4868, cp=36, fin=1).
 *
 *       So: leave the physics alone, let the race finish the way it always does,
 *       and set the position.  What the checks assert is "finishPos == 1 implies
 *       the WIN cutscene, the amulet and RACE_CLEARED" -- an implication about the
 *       verdict, not about who is faster -- and this isolates exactly that one
 *       variable while leaving the racing line bit-identical to the losing arm.
 *
 *       Written from the frame boundary rather than at the finish itself so this
 *       stays out of game/ race-finish code.  There is a wide window: measured on
 *       boss 38, raceFinished latches at frame ~8900 and racer_boss_finish() does
 *       not read finishPosition until ~9095.
 *
 * All three are no-ops unless set.  Called once per frame from
 * platform_frame_sync().
