/*
 * gfx_webgpu.c — Cross-platform WebGPU (wgpu-native) render backend.
 *
 * Implements the Fast3D `GfxRenderingAPI` vtable (gfx_rendering_api.h) — the
 * same ~23-function seam gfx_opengl.c and gfx_metal.mm fill — against the
 * standard webgpu.h C API. Selected at runtime by the renderer environment
 * variable; compiled and linked only when MDKR_WEBGPU_BACKEND (see
 * cmake/webgpu.cmake). The same translation unit serves native (wgpu-native)
 * and browser (emdawnwebgpu) builds; every dialect difference is confined to
 * gfx_webgpu_compat.h.
 *
 * Invariants this file holds:
 *   - The whole vtable is filled: a caller may invoke any GfxRenderingAPI entry
 *     point in any order the frontend produces, and no entry point may crash on
 *     a partially initialized or already-lost device.
 *   - The scene is rendered into an offscreen color/depth pair and copied to the
 *     surface at present, so the surface's format and usages never constrain the
 *     draw path, and readback always has a stable source texture.
 *   - Surface loss/outdate/timeout is TRANSIENT and retried; device, queue,
 *     validation and allocation failures latch a FATAL state that stops
 *     simulation at the next scheduler boundary rather than drawing garbage.
 *   - GPU objects owned by an embedding app shell are adopted, never released
 *     here; objects this file creates are released exactly once at shutdown.

 * doubled frame -- and during a camera pan a doubled frame is a visible

 * Wayland) exist only in wgpu-native's webgpu.h, so they must stay on the
 * native side of this fork; the browser builds a canvas-selector surface.
 * (The other is PERF-005's async-pipeline block at wgpu_pipeline_for /
 * on_pipeline_ready: it must be absent from the native TU so native stays
 * byte-for-byte HEAD, and the async create/callback API has no native test
 * coverage. Its per-frame completion drain lives in the compat seam as
 * WGPU_COMPAT_DRAIN.)
 *
 * Native path is parameterized by the platform handle so BOTH the engine
 * (standalone) and the app shell (AppHost, which owns the window/layer before
 * the game adopts it) create surfaces the same way. macOS uses `metal_layer`
 * (a CAMetalLayer); every other native platform uses `window` (resolved to
 * HWND/X11/Wayland by platformWebGpuWindowInfo). Browser ignores both handles
 * (the page owns exactly one canvas). Declared in gfx_webgpu_compat.h.
 *
 * Verified against the emdawnwebgpu port's webgpu.h at build time; keep
 * "#canvas" in sync with web/index.html (W5).

     * Instead, hold the current committed size until the requested size has been
     * stable for WGPU_RESIZE_STABLE_FRAMES consecutive frames, then apply it once.

     * Why this variant cannot produce a visible error/black frame: the surface and

     * held surface, wgpuSurfaceGetCurrentTexture returns SuccessSuboptimal (already
     * accepted as present_ok) and the compositor scales — no error, no black frame.
     * The transient during an active drag is at most a briefly-scaled / viewport-
     * clamped image for a few frames, which snaps crisp the instant the size settles.
     *
     * Cannot wedge: this runs every frame, and any size held for STABLE_FRAMES
     * commits — so the final size after a drag (held indefinitely once the mouse is
     * released) always applies. The first size ever seen (s_cfg_w == 0) and any size
     * already live (req == committed) apply immediately, so a fixed-resolution run
     * (every headless gate) never debounces and stays byte-identical.
     *
     * Web note: the browser canvas resizes are rare and ResizeObserver-driven (not a
     * per-frame drag), so in practice this only affects native drags; the mechanism is

 * WEB-068: the key is a RAW POINTER tuple, so a cached entry MUST be invalidated

 * a deleted texture's view pointer is replaced by the white fallback in the key,
 * which misses." That reasoning only covers the CURRENT draw's freshly-built key; it
 * missed that STALE entries built by earlier draws outlive the texture and keep its
 * raw view pointer. wgpuTextureViewRelease frees the C-handle ADDRESS for reuse while
 * the cached bind group keeps the underlying object alive (a strong ref) — so a later
 * texture whose new view lands at the recycled address FALSE-MATCHED a stale entry and

 * cache slots referencing its view (wgpu_tex_bg_ref_add on insert), so a release walks
 * only its own slots (wgpu_bg_cache_invalidate_view_indexed). No dedicated level-flush
 * hook was added: the natural flush IS gfx_clear_texture_cache's per-texture delete
 * loop (gfx_pc.c)—which the reverse index already makes cheap—and a distinct backend
 * flush entry point would require touching gfx_pc.c / gfx_rendering_api.h, out

 * creates async (web-live) — but that traded the freeze for transient pop-in /
 * present-holds whenever the camera meets a COLD material (worst at level entry,
 * where EVERY material is cold). Phase 2 removes the cold set for revisits and
 * repeat sessions: RECORD the (shader_id0, shader_id1, pipe-key) tuples actually
 * used per stage, PERSIST them to a small text manifest in the save dir, and
 * REPLAY them SYNCHRONOUSLY during the next load screen (gfx_webgpu_prewarm_stage,
 * called from boss.c while the watchdog is suppressed and the load screen is up).
 * The async path stays the safety net for genuinely-new keys.
 *
 * CRUX (shader-creation-at-load): a recorded shader may not have a ShaderProgram
 * yet at load time (its first draw hasn't happened). That is fine — the shader is
 * built PURELY from the ids: wgpu_create_and_load_new_shader → gfx_webgpu_build_wgsl
 * → gfx_cc_get_features is a self-contained decode of (shader_id0, shader_id1) with
 * ZERO gfx_pc render state, so prewarm creates the module too. Full scope: a
 * persisted manifest warms everything from the second launch's first frame.
 *
 * Scope gate: record/persist/prewarm run only when the webgpu backend is the
 * active one and NOT under --deterministic (so every byte-exact gate stays on the
 * untouched synchronous HEAD path — prewarm never runs there). Persistence is
 * best-effort: any I/O failure just means "no prewarm", never fatal. */

/* Clamp a Y-flipped viewport rect to a rect WebGPU will accept, AND report the

 * WebGPU validates setViewport containment, so an out-of-range rect has to be
 * clamped -- but clamping changes the transform, whereas glViewport and Metal
 * keep the transform and merely clip the pixels. DKR relies on the GL/Metal
 * behaviour: mtx_ortho() deliberately sets vp.vscale[1] = width*2, asking for a
 * viewport 320 logical pixels tall on a 240-tall target -- (0,-40,320,320)
 * logical, (0,-160,1280,1280) at this port's 4x HiDPI scale. Clamping that to
 * the target cuts its half-height from 160 to 120, a uniform 0.75 vertical
 * squash about the screen centre. (Measured: FILE_SELECT's wooden buttons came
 * out 48 rows tall against the real ROM's 64.)
 *
 * So: rasterize with the clamped rect, but pre-apply the inverse affine to
 * clip-space x/y. In WebGPU's top-down framebuffer space, requiring the
 * requested rect R and the clamped rect C to land a vertex on the same pixel:
 *     Rx + (ndc_x+1)/2 * Rw  ==  Cx + (ndc'_x+1)/2 * Cw
 *   =>  ndc'_x = ndc_x * (Rw/Cw) + ((2*(Rx-Cx) + Rw)/Cw - 1)
 *     Ry + (1-ndc_y)/2 * Rh  ==  Cy + (1-ndc'_y)/2 * Ch
 *   =>  ndc'_y = ndc_y * (Rh/Ch) + (1 - (2*(Ry-Cy) + Rh)/Ch)
 * Geometry the rescale pushes outside the NDC cube maps outside the clamped
 * rect -- i.e. off-target -- so clipping it is correct.
 *
