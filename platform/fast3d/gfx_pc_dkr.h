/**
 * gfx_pc_dkr.h — F3DDKR display-list interpreter (HLE) public API.
 *
 * This is the DKR-specific front-end of the fast3d renderer for mdkr64. It
 * decodes Diddy Kong Racing's custom F3DDKR microcode command stream and drives
 * the shared GfxRenderingAPI backends (OpenGL / Metal) that are reused verbatim
 * from mgb64. It is the structural sibling of mgb64's gfx_pc.h, but DKR's GBI is
 * a different command set (10-byte vertices with per-triangle UVs, G_TRIN
 * polygon batches, G_DMADL sub-lists, a 3-slot MVP matrix system and
 * billboarding), so the interpreter core is bespoke.
 *
 * Derived-from attribution (see platform/fast3d/PROVENANCE.md): texture decode,
 * color-combiner→shader translation, VBO packing and RDP state handling are
 * ported from Emill/n64-fast3d-engine via mgb64's gfx_pc.c. The F3DDKR command
 * semantics are from game/include/f3ddkr.h and the DKR decomp call sites.
