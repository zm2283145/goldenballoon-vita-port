/*
 * Immutable renderer task retained for presentation-only replay.
 *
 * DKR authors display lists and their transitive matrix/vertex/texture data in
 * a reusable RDRAM stand-in. By the time a high-refresh presentation wants to
 * draw an intermediate image, the game may already have reused that memory for
 * the next task. A command pointer is therefore not ownership.
 *
 * This module publishes one complete authored task transactionally. The arena
 * image, top-level list, segment bases, and explicitly observed non-arena
 * dependencies all belong to the same immutable authored-tick token. Readers
 * either acquire that whole task or fail; a partial capture is never visible.
