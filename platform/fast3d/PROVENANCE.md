# Provenance — `platform/fast3d/`

The Fast3D display-list interpreter and its GPU backends in this directory are a
**derivative of third-party code**, not original MGB64 work. This file records
that origin and reproduces the applicable license notice, as required by the
upstream license (see the source-redistribution condition below).

> **Vendored file.** This document came with the backend from the author's
> GoldenEye port **mgb64**, and is kept close to its mgb64 form deliberately so the
> two projects can converge on common code. Where it says "MGB64" the same statements
> apply to this port; where it names mgb64 paths, the Golden Balloon equivalents are:

## Origin

| File(s) | Derived from | License |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gfx_opengl.c`, `gfx_rendering_api.h`, `gfx_cc.c`, `gfx_cc.h` | Emill/n64-fast3d-engine — `https://github.com/Emill/n64-fast3d-engine` (attributed in each file header) | n64-fast3d-engine license — modified BSD-2-Clause (see below) |
| `gfx_cc.c`, `gfx_cc.h` | Emill/n64-fast3d-engine, **rewritten for 2-cycle support** based on the [fgsfdsfgs/perfect_dark](https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/perfect_dark) port | n64-fast3d-engine license — modified BSD-2-Clause (see below) |
| `gfx_uniforms.h`, `gfx_screen_config.h` | MGB64-authored shared declarations written against the upstream `GfxRenderingAPI` seam, used by the GL and WebGPU backends. (A standalone Metal backend, `gfx_metal.mm`, was vendored the same way and used the libultraship Metal backend (Kenix3, MIT) as a structural reference only; it was never compiled into any build target and was removed post-1.0.6 — see [`../../NOTICE.md`](../../NOTICE.md).) | MIT (first-party, per repo [LICENSE](../../LICENSE)) |
| `gfx_msaa_util.c`, `gfx_msaa_util.h`, `gfx_palette.h`, `gfx_texgen.h`, `screenshot_series.c`, `screenshot_series.h` | MGB64-authored support code vendored alongside the backends (MSAA sample selection, palette and texgen helpers, the screenshot series harness). `screenshot_series.c` is excluded from this project's build. | MIT (first-party, per repo [LICENSE](../../LICENSE)) |
| `gfx_pc_dkr.c`, `gfx_pc_dkr.h` | **Golden Balloon-authored** F3DDKR display-list interpreter: written for this project because DKR uses its own microcode (F3DDKR) rather than F3DEX, so upstream's `gfx_pc.c` could not be reused. It targets the same upstream `GfxRenderingAPI` seam and reuses upstream's combiner (`gfx_cc.c`) and VBO attribute layout, so it is a derivative of that interface. | MIT (first-party, per repo [LICENSE](../../LICENSE)) |
| `gfx_webgpu.c`, `gfx_webgpu.h`, `gfx_webgpu_shader.c`, `gfx_webgpu_shader.h`, `gfx_webgpu_compat.h` | **MGB64-authored origin**, ported from mgb64 `src/platform/fast3d/` at M4.5 and subsequently adapted for this project's DKR lifecycle, app handoff, presentation, recovery, and validation needs. Implements the same upstream `GfxRenderingAPI` seam. Runtime WGSL shader generator (`gfx_webgpu_shader.c`) consumes the shared `gfx_cc.c` combiner output. | MIT (first-party, per repo [LICENSE](../../LICENSE)) |
| `smaa_area_tex.h`, `smaa_search_tex.h` | Generated LUTs — see [`../../NOTICE.md`](../../NOTICE.md) (SMAA) | MIT |

The WebGPU backend links **wgpu-native** (gfx-rs, the C `webgpu.h` implementation)
as a **pinned prebuilt** — see `cmake/webgpu.cmake` (version `v29.0.1.1`, SHA-256
verified). wgpu-native is dual MIT/Apache-2.0; only its prebuilt static lib is
consumed (no source vendored). Under Emscripten (M8) WebGPU comes from the
browser via the `emdawnwebgpu` port instead, so no wgpu-native there.

The MGB64-authored files above build on the upstream's `GfxRenderingAPI` seam and
data structures; they are covered by MGB64's own MIT license but are noted here so
the boundary with the upstream code is explicit.

## Upstream license (n64-fast3d-engine)

The n64-fast3d-engine upstream is **not** MIT-licensed (an earlier revision of
this file incorrectly reproduced an MIT notice). It is distributed under a
custom, BSD-2-Clause–style license: source redistribution is permitted on
BSD-style terms, but **binary redistribution is restricted** to binaries that
contain no assets the distributor lacks the right to distribute. The notice
below was reconciled verbatim against the authoritative upstream `LICENSE.txt`
(`https://github.com/Emill/n64-fast3d-engine/blob/master/LICENSE.txt`):

```

**Binary-redistribution note (condition 2).** MGB64's prebuilt binaries contain
no ROM or ROM-derived assets: they load a user-supplied ROM at runtime and are
verified asset-free by `macos/Scripts/verify_asset_free.sh` (built binary/app)
and the source-tree guard `scripts/ci/check_no_rom_data.sh`. They therefore
satisfy condition 2, which is what permits distributing them at all.

The 2-cycle combiner work in `gfx_cc.c` additionally derives from the Perfect Dark
decompilation/port (MIT); see the `platform/mixer.c` and `gfx_cc.c` rows in
[`THIRD_PARTY.md`](../../THIRD_PARTY.md) for that project's licensing.
