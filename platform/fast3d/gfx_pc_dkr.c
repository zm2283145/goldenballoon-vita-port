/**
 * gfx_pc_dkr.c — F3DDKR display-list interpreter (HLE) for mdkr64.
 *
 * Decodes Diddy Kong Racing's custom F3DDKR microcode command stream into modern
 * GPU draw calls via the shared GfxRenderingAPI backend (gfx_opengl.c /
 * gfx_metal.mm, reused verbatim from mgb64).
 *
 * PROVENANCE (see platform/fast3d/PROVENANCE.md): the RDP-side machinery here —
 * texture format decoders, the color-combiner→shader translation
 * (dkr_generate_cc), the per-vertex VBO packing that feeds the backend shaders,
 * the tile/TMEM model and the screen-rectangle path — is ported from
 * Emill/n64-fast3d-engine by way of mgb64's src/platform/fast3d/gfx_pc.c
 * (n64-fast3d-engine license, modified BSD-2-Clause). Diagnostics, GE007-specific
 * hacks and the base-GBI opcode decode of that file were dropped; the F3DDKR
 * command decode and the DKR vertex/triangle/matrix/billboard pipeline are new,
 * written from game/include/f3ddkr.h, game/include/structs.h and the DKR decomp
 * call sites (objects.c, particles.c, camera.c, textures_sprites.c, rcp_dkr.c).
 * Command semantics cross-checked against GLideN64 src/uCodes/F3DDKR.cpp.
 *
 * ENDIANNESS / LAYOUT: per PLAN.md decision 7, all in-memory DL / vertex /
 * triangle / matrix data is assumed NATIVE-endian (a separate asset-load
 * workstream byteswaps ROM data). This file therefore reads struct fields
 * directly. It also reads through the compiled struct TYPES (Vertex, Triangle,
 * Gfx, Mtx) rather than hardcoded byte strides, so it stays correct whatever
 * width `u32` resolves to (see the report's note on ultratypes.h).
 *
 * LP64 STRUCT-SIZE LOCKS (critical): the on-wire DKR command/data structs must
 * keep their exact N64 byte size on every host width, or the game-side buffer
 * layout math desyncs from the writer/reader stride. Two members are N64 `long`
 * (32-bit) that inflate to 8 bytes on LP64 and are pinned back to 32-bit under
 * NATIVE_PORT in PR/gbi.h:
 *   - Mtx_t (matrix element) — else Mtx is 128 B not 64 B.
 *   - Gsetcolor.color (a Gfx union member) — else `sizeof(Gfx)` is 16 not 8.
 * The `sizeof(Gfx)==8` lock matters because game code builds DL buffers whose DL
 * region is sized with a LITERAL 8-byte Gfx stride (e.g. tex_load_sprite reserves
 * `numTextures * 0x20` == 4*sizeof(Gfx) per tile) while the DL WRITER advances by
 * the real `sizeof(Gfx)`. If they disagree, the DL region over-runs into the
 * following VERTEX region and sprite quads read back Gfx-command bytes — the
 * billboard "red spikes / thin bars" over karts and menu sprites. (Fixed at
 * source; this interpreter reads Gfx at whatever stride the type reports, so it
 * was consistent with the writer either way — the corruption was purely the
 * game-side literal-vs-sizeof mismatch caused by the inflated Gfx.)
 *
 * ADDRESS RESOLUTION: every pointer embedded in a DL word (w1) is a 32-bit
 * physical/tagged value (the Gfx word is `unsigned int`, i.e. truncated on
 * LP64). We resolve it with gfx_resolve_addr() from platform/gfx_ptr.h, which
 * consults the segment table then the truncated→full pointer registry. The
 * OS-shim workstream owns the store side: it must register every host pointer
 * that reaches a DL word via gfx_ptr_store() (PLAN decision 3).

 * registering -- render_sprite_billboard's two pushes and
 * render_ortho_triangle_image's one. A plain lookup on those addresses returns
 * the FIRST tenant's binding, which describes a matrix that no longer exists
 * there.
 *
 * Measured on 2d697f6, level 40, MDKR_PRESENT_RATE=60: all 14 hard rejects were
 * dead tenants (`bytesmoved=1` on every line), 13 of them registered by
 * mtx_cam_push and 1 by mtx_head_push, and the worlds they served were track
 * geometry -- a 960-unit tile grid at a constant y = -43, plus tiles at
 * z = 3870/4515. Those worlds were not only recomposed against the wrong
 * matrix; they were fed to the shadow CASTER as the world of whatever billboard
 * had since taken the address. render_sprite_billboard's vehicle-part branch
 * (wheels, propellers, fans) does NOT enable billboard mode, so it takes the
 * caster path at full strength -- car wheels were casting shadows from track
 * tiles up to 3,107 world units away. That is the live visual defect, and it
 * exists whether or not anything is being interpolated.
 *
 * Comparing the registered image against the live bytes is what makes tenancy
 * checkable at all: a matching image means this binding still describes what is
 * at the key, and a mismatch is a MISS, exactly as if the address had never
 * been registered. A miss is always safe -- the caster skips the vertex and the
 * replay keeps the display list's own matrix.
 *
 * A binding without key_bytes_valid predates the tagging (only camera.c tags,
 * and it tags every registration) and is refused rather than trusted.

 * Real RDP TMEM stores every ODD texture row with the two 32-bit halves of each
 * 64-bit word exchanged, and the texture-fetch unit un-exchanges them on the way
 * out. LOADBLOCK normally performs that exchange itself, driven by the `dxt`
 * line-advance rate, so DRAM holds a plain linear image and the two swaps cancel.
 *
 * `dxt` is a 1.11 reciprocal (CALC_DXT = ceil(2048 / words_per_line)), so it can
 * only express a row length exactly when the row is a power-of-two number of
 * 64-bit words. For every other width the accumulator drifts and rows get
 * mis-swapped, so libultra offers the `...S` macro family — "the S at the end
 * means odd lines are already word Swapped" (PR/gbi.h:2699) — which passes
 * dxt = 0 (no load-time exchange) and relies on the ASSET being pre-swizzled to
 * cancel the fetch-time exchange instead. DKR's asset tool does exactly that and

 * because every screen frees the previous screen's assets and reloads into the
 * same pool (all ten TRACK SELECT world backgrounds are 64x32 RGBA16, so they
 * alias each other perfectly).
 *
 * Fix: the game's allocator tells us when arena bytes are recycled
 * (mempool_slot_clear -> here), and every entry overlapping that span is
 * dropped. Steady-state cost is one pass over the cache per free; no hashing.

 * RSP clip-ratio emulation.
 *
 * On the N64 the viewport is ONLY the NDC->screen affine map. Triangle clipping
 * happens against the clip volume scaled by the ratio in gSPClipRatio, and the
 * RDP scissor is what actually bounds the rasterized image. DKR's RSP init sets
 * gsSPClipRatio(FRUSTRATIO_2) (rcp_dkr.c dRspInit), so geometry survives out to
 * twice the viewport extent and the scissor decides where the picture stops.
 *
 * A host GPU has no such knob: it clips at NDC +-1, which IS the viewport
 * rectangle. So wherever an authored scissor reaches past its authored
 * viewport, world geometry stops at the viewport edge and whatever the frame
 * clear left behind shows through instead.
 *
 * PAL gameplay is exactly that case. camera.c's viewport_scissor_set() shifts
 * the one-player viewport centre four logical pixels left on PAL
 * ("if (osTvType == OS_TV_TYPE_PAL) posX -= 4;") while leaving the scissor at
 * the full 320x264 surface, so logical columns 316..319 sit outside the
 * viewport. Hardware fills them from the clip-ratio-2 overdraw -- an ares PAL
 * capture of the Ancient Lake start line shows scene content in every visible
 * framebuffer column -- but here they rendered as the frame-clear colour, a
 * flat band that changed hue every frame (24 host pixels wide at 1920).
 *
 * The fix widens the rectangle handed to the backend until it covers the
 * scissor, capped at the ratio-2 box the RSP would really have clipped to, and
 * folds the difference back into clip space so the world-to-window mapping is
 * bit-for-bit the same affine transform:
 *
 *   window_x = Vx + (ndc + 1)/2 * Vw                          (authored)
 *            = Ex + (ndc * Vw/Ew + bias_x + 1)/2 * Ew         (expanded)
 *   bias_x   = (2*(Vx - Ex) + Vw - Ew) / Ew
 *
 * Where the viewport already covers the scissor -- every NTSC/MPAL path, and
 * every screen-space rectangle, which sets viewport == scissor == drawable --
 * this is the identity and the emitter skips it entirely, so those frames stay
 * byte-identical.

 * Every triangle is clipped against the near plane in HOMOGENEOUS CLIP SPACE

 * from discarding out-of-range fragments. A vertex behind the eye (w <= 0)
 * therefore still went through the perspective divide, and dividing by a
 * negative w mirrors the vertex through the origin, flinging that corner to the
 * far side of the screen: the triangle renders as a long stretched sliver
 * instead of being cut at the near plane. That is the "stretched bar / spike"
 * artifact class (see docs/OPEN_ITEMS.md).
 *
 * The plane is `z + w >= 0`, i.e. z_ndc >= -1, which is the TRUE near plane and
 * not merely `w > 0`. For a well-formed perspective projection the two are
 * equivalent in the useful direction: writing z = -(f+n)/(f-n)·z_e - 2fn/(f-n)
 * and w = -z_e gives z + w = (-2f/(f-n))·(z_e + n), so z + w >= 0 iff
 * z_e <= -n, and every such point has w = -z_e >= n > 0. So clipping on this one
 * plane both cuts at the correct depth and guarantees a positive w downstream.
 *
 * Clipping happens in clip space, before the divide. Position, UV and shade
 * attributes are evaluated at that homogeneous edge intersection. Fog is the
 * deliberate exception: its stored byte has already been derived from
 * post-divide z/w, so a generated vertex must recompute it from its new
 * position rather than blend two endpoint bytes. During rasterization texture
 * coordinates remain perspective-correct, while RDP shade and fog coefficients
 * are explicitly screen-linear.
 *
 * Sutherland-Hodgman against a single plane turns a triangle into at most a
 * quad, which is then fan-triangulated. Deliberately NOT a cull: dropping
 * straddling triangles would punch holes in geometry that legitimately crosses
 * the near plane.

/*
 * WHAT SCROLLS, AND HOW IT TRAVELS.
 *
 * No DKR scroller uses G_SETTILESIZE, gSPTexture or a texture matrix. Every one
 * of them rewrites the S10.5 corner UVs inside a Triangle array IN PLACE, once
 * per authored tick, and gSPPolygon (G_TRIN) carries only a pointer to that
 * array. The drivers are obj_loop_texscroll (BHV_TEXTURE_SCROLL — the level-wide
 * waterfall/river/lava scroller, matched by texture index), obj_loop_animator
 * (BHV_ANIMATOR — one segment/batch), the generated wave surfaces in waves.c,
 * and the rain/particle/skydome sheets. They differ only in which triangles they
 * touch and in their wrap modulus.
 *
 * That is why this census does not need to know which driver owns a batch. The
 * retained task holds tick T's bytes for the array; the already-authored next
 * task names the same array now holding T+1. The difference of the two IS the
 * tick's displacement, whatever produced it.
 *
 * THE WRAP RULE.
 *
 * Each driver periodically folds a corner back into range by adding or
 * subtracting a whole number of texture repeats: texscroll uses width<<8 and
 * height<<8 (8 repeats), the animator width<<7 (4 repeats), waves width*32
 * (1 repeat), rain (width<<5)*2, the skydome width<<9, and the particle sheet a
 * flat 512. Every one of those moduli is a multiple of 32 — one texel — because
 * they are all whole repeats of a texture whose width is a whole number of
 * texels. A folded corner therefore reports a raw difference of D - k*M rather
 * than the true displacement D.
 *
 * Interpolating the RAW difference would sweep a scrolling surface through the
 * whole texture inside one tick. So the shortest wrap distance is recovered
 * structurally instead of numerically: every triangle in a batch receives the
 * SAME displacement, a batch is at most 16 triangles, and the folds are keyed
 * off each triangle's own first corner, so the un-folded triangles state D
 * directly. Small differences — at or below DKR_UV_SCROLL_MAX_DELTA, eight
 * texels a tick, well above any authored scroll (the fastest measured is four)
 * — are the candidates for D, and they must all agree; every larger difference
 * must then be D offset by an exact multiple of one texel.
 *
 * Everything else refuses. Two disagreeing small candidates is exactly what a
 * fold shorter than the limit produces, and it refuses the batch outright
 * rather than picking one. A batch where every triangle folded on the same tick
 * leaves no un-folded candidate at all, and the displacement it would report is
 * D minus the modulus; gfx_presentation_packet_lookup_uv_scroll is what keeps
 * that off the screen, because it requires the previous published tick to have
 * agreed on the same displacement. Authored scroll speed is a level constant,
 * so a real scroller confirms on its second tick and stays confirmed, while a
 * transient misread would have to repeat itself exactly to survive — which a
 * fold, by definition, does not do on consecutive ticks.

                 * rebuild it from the registry's (world, view_projection)
                 * decomposition, through the game's own mtxf_mul/mtxf_to_mtx
                 * (mdkr_camera_replay_mvp). That is only sound if the
                 * decomposition actually reproduces the matrix the game built —
                 * and it does not always. mtx_head_rotation (camera.c) computes
                 * its list matrix as head x (parentWorld x VP) but must
                 * register a world of (head x parentWorld). Over a 3600-tick
                 * route, blindly recomposing every gameplay matrix moved 5178
                 * of 35119 of them, the worst by 152,081,586 s15.16 LSBs —
                 * about 2320 world units. That is not rounding, and shipping it
                 * would have teleported geometry on every interpolated frame.
                 *
                 * So the replay PROVES the decomposition per matrix, per frame:
                 * recompose with the view-projection AS CAPTURED and compare
                 * against the display list's own bytes. Bit-identical means the
                 * decomposition is faithful and the same arithmetic with a
                 * different camera is trustworthy. Anything else keeps the
                 * list's matrix — that object holds its authoritative pose for
                 * this frame, which is exactly what camera-only interpolation
                 * already does for every object, and is never worse than not
                 * replaying at all.
                 *
                 * GEOMETRIC TOLERANCE (only when the camera was overridden).
                 * Bit-exact equality is the wrong test for a decomposition whose
                 * only sin is re-associating a float product: 99.96% of the
                 * mismatches measured across all 63 levels are ≤ a few thousand
                 * s15.16 LSBs — thousandths to hundredths of a world unit — and
                 * are correct associations that rounded differently. Rejecting
                 * them keeps the TICK's camera for that geometry, so an
                 * interpolated frame mixed two cameras across up to a fifth of
                 * its scene. On the vp-overridden path the verification is
                 * therefore a distance, not an identity:
                 * DKR_RECOMPOSE_TOLERANCE_LSB above.
                 *
                 * The NON-overridden path stays BIT-EXACT, deliberately. There
                 * the display list already holds the exact matrix, so a
                 * tolerance could only permit a needless precision loss — and
                 * check_render_purity.py's arm E forces exactly that path and
                 * asserts the replay overdraws IDENTICALLY. Widening it here
                 * would disarm that arm.
                 *
                 * Nothing here writes to the captured display list or to game
