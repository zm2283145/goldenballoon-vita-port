 * Quantize an interpolation phase onto the grid the DISPLAY retires presents
 * on (M3 slice 1).
 *
 * WHY. Interpolation alpha is measured from the wall clock at frame-BUILD
 * time, but the image is scanned out at the next vblank. Under a
 * vblank-quantized queue those two differ by the pacer's wake jitter -- the
 * FIFO/compositor slop between the vblank and the loop actually running -- and
 * that jitter lands directly in the phase the player sees, because uneven
 * phase is exactly what interpolated motion shows as stutter. The frames
 * themselves arrive on a perfectly regular grid; only the SAMPLING of time is
 * noisy.
 *
 * WHAT. `phase_units` is the measured phase and `tick_units` the authoritative
 * tick, both in the accumulator's exact units (see present_sched.h). Under a
 * queue that retires one present per refresh, the frame being built now is
 * displayed one refresh after the frame before it, so its phase is an exact
 * whole number of refresh periods -- `quantum_units` -- past the tick's own
 * endpoint. Rounding the measured phase to that grid recovers the number the
 * display will actually show it at. The constant one-refresh pipeline latency
 * is common to every frame and cancels in the difference, so this corrects the
 * phase's EVENNESS without adding or removing latency.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. Nothing here feeds the accumulator. The tick that a
 * given host opportunity belongs to, and the moment ticks become due, are
 * untouched: this is a presentation-alpha sampling change only, which is what
 * the byte-identity gates (tests/check_arbitrary_presentation_rates.py) prove.
 *
 * WHEN IT DECLINES. `quantum_units` of 0 means the caller's presents are not
 * vblank-quantized at all (synthetic pacing, a software cadence cap, a tearing
 * queue, an unreported refresh) and the measured phase is returned unchanged.
 * So is a phase of 0 -- that is a tick endpoint, whose alpha is exact by
 * construction -- and any projection that lands at or past the next tick, where
 * the clock is the better authority.
 *
 * MONOTONICITY. Within one tick the result never runs backwards. Rounding is
 * monotone, and a later present that declines the grid declines it only from a
 * strictly higher grid index, so its measured phase is at least half a quantum
 * past the last quantized value. That matters because the pacing-quality census
 * gates `regressions=0` on the differenced phase series.

 * Slot-projected interpolation phase for a disciplined display cadence.
 *
 * Under a closed-loop FIFO pacer, one displayed frame IS one display slot,
 * so the drawn phase should advance by exactly one quantum per replay —
 * reading it off the wake clock instead bakes scheduler jitter into every
 * motion step (the measured p95 was 0.385 tick against an ideal constant
 * 0.25 at 120 Hz). This projector predicts last + quantum and keeps the
 * prediction whenever the measured phase agrees within SNAP; a larger
 * disagreement (a genuinely missed slot) re-anchors onto the measured grid
 * point and is counted. A prediction that would touch the tick boundary
 * clamps to tick_units - 1: the tick/display beat's extra slot becomes one
 * soft repeat of (nearly) the incoming endpoint image rather than a
 * mid-tick stutter.
 *
 * The first replay of a tick is judged the same way, by increment: the
 * elapsed phase since the previous tick's last replay (whole ticks crossed
 * plus the wrapped measured delta — still offset-invariant) is two slots at
 * a healthy cadence and keeps the historical one-quantum start; anything
 * clearly longer means the run is presenting slower than the display and
 * the first interior anchors to the quantized measured phase instead. A
 * 64 fps capture-rig session proved the pinned start wrong: every tick drew
 * an endpoint/quarter pair while the pose pairs had really advanced half a
 * tick or more between opportunities.
