// ui_settings.h — settings panel generated from the video/gameplay schema.
//
// DKR ADAPTATION. mgb64's panel enumerates its own engine config registry
// (mgb_config_*) and opens an explicit staging session in the overlay, because
// that registry writes straight into live globals and needs Apply/Cancel to be
// safe. mdkr64 already has that transaction built into the config layer:
// mdkr_video_config_runtime_set() validates, persists, and then publishes only
// the LIVE-scope half, leaving RESTART-scope values staged in `desired` for the
// next launch. So this panel drives that API directly instead of layering a
// second staging model on top of it — every edit is already all-or-nothing.
