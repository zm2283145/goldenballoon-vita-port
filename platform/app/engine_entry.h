// matters most. The tee therefore publishes the PRE-tee console fd and the raw
// mdkr64.log fd here, and the engine's crash handler writes to them directly,

// platform/app/crash_screen.cpp here; NULL (every CLI invocation) means the
// handler behaves exactly as it did before the crash screen existed.

// The pointer types are named, and named HERE, so that they pick up this
// header's C language linkage. The struct itself must stay inside the extern "C"
// block -- platform/app_overlay_hooks.c and tests/test_app_overlay_hooks.c are
// real C consumers -- and a C-linkage member can only legally be assigned a

// therefore defined inside an `extern "C" { static ... }` block (internal
