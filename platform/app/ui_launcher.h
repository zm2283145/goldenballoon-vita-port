// ui_launcher.h — the pre-boot launcher: nav rail + table-driven panel router.
//
// Panels are free functions over a shared LauncherState, so the router is one
// table and a new panel is one row.
//
// DKR ADAPTATION: mgb64's launcher carries Launch (level/difficulty/players)
// and Modes (engine toggle hatches) panels. Neither exists here — DKR's engine
// exposes no level or difficulty CLI, and its presentation modes are already
// first-class schema keys — so the panel set is Play / Online Room / Settings /
// Diagnostics / About rather than mgb64's six. Panels DKR has no analogue for
// are absent, not present and inert.
//
// Panel 0 is Play: the home, which carries the ROM onboarding as a STATE
// rather than as a separate destination named after a file format. Online Room
// is compiled for development only with MDKR_ENABLE_ONLINE_ROOM_PREVIEW=ON and
// then drawn under MDKR_ONLINE_ROOM_PREVIEW=1 (see panelVisible in
// ui_launcher.cpp), so a shipped build offers exactly what the release offers;
// its INDEX is unconditional either way, because the constants below are a
// public smoke contract.
