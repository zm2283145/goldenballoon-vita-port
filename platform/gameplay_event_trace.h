 * A second reader of the same ordered stream.
 *
 * The hash stream answers "did these two runs do the same things"; an observer
 * answers "what just happened", which is what a presentation layer such as the
 * race announcer needs. Both read the events the port already publishes, so a
 * feature that reacts to race events costs no new observation point inside the
 * race code -- which is the whole reason this hook exists rather than a second
 * set of calls scattered through game/src.
 *
 * Installing an observer arms the emission sites (so the events actually reach
 * it) but changes nothing about the hash: `[EVENTHASH]` rows are still printed
 * only when MDKR_EVENT_HASH is set, and their bytes are unaffected by whether
 * anybody is observing. At most one observer; NULL removes it. The pointer must
 * outlive the process -- pass a file-scope constant, not a stack value.
