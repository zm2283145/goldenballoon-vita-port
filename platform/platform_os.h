 * per rendered frame and returns that as `updateRate` (LOGIC_60FPS=1 @ 60fps,
 * LOGIC_30FPS=2 @ 30fps, ...). Movement, physics AND the race clock all scale by
 * updateRate, so a correct updateRate is what keeps wall-clock speed constant as
 * the render rate varies (DKR's native frameskip compensation).
 *
 * On N64 the VI interrupt posts retrace messages to that queue ASYNCHRONOUSLY at
 * 60 Hz. Our cooperative shim has no async producer, so without this pacer the
 * drain always finds 0 and updateRate pins at 1 regardless of the real present
 * cadence — motion desyncs from real time. The native driver converts host
 * elapsed time into fixed one- or two-field tickets. Ordinary lateness becomes
 * repeated tickets; it never becomes one oversized gameplay update.
 *
 * platform_vi_pace_measure() paces the present to the configured simulation
 * floor: two 60 Hz fields for original/authored gameplay (default), or one for
