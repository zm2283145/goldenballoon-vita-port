     *     policy ONCE, on the first platform_present_subloop_fields() call,
     *     into file-static deadline state.
     *   - gfx_pc_dkr.c's gfx_start_frame()/gfx_end_frame() capture the replay's
     *     walk-entry state (dkr_walk_entry_*) and freeze the shadow matrix
     *     registry only when present_sched_replay_armed() is true, and
     *     present_sched.c arms the presentation snapshot store behind a
     *     one-shot (s_snapshot_forced).
     *
     * Writing the new value straight from the setter is unsafe in BOTH
     * directions, and this is the hazard the deferred apply exists to close.
     * Engaging late is dead cost: the freeze/snapshot work starts happening but
     * the subloop never runs, because the platform policy was already latched
     * inactive. Disengaging late is worse than dead: the subloop is still
     * latched ON, while present_sched_replay_armed() has gone false, so
     * gfx_start_frame stops refreshing dkr_walk_entry_* -- which
     * gfx_dkr_replay_invalidate() is the only thing that ever clears -- and
     * gfx_dkr_replay_walk() goes on memcpy'ing a STALE segment table
     * (gfx_pc_dkr.c's replay branch) into the live HLE state. Stale segment
     * bases are wild pointers.
     *
     * WHAT MAKES IT SAFE NOW. Nothing here is bypassed; the latches are still
     * latches, and they are re-latched rather than mutated. The setter only
     * marks MDKR_VIDEO_APPLY_PRESENTATION pending. The engine's host-frame
     * boundary (stubs_dkr.c's osRecvMesg video-queue branch, entered after the
     * previous authoritative pass and its whole subloop have completed, and
     * before the next tick's platform_present_subloop_fields() call) then runs
     * platform_present_config_apply() as ONE ordered step:
     * gfx_dkr_replay_invalidate() first -- so no walk-entry state survives the
     * change in either direction -- then the snapshot stage reset, then the
     * policy push, then a full re-init of the pacer state machine and the
     * backend's present mode. There is no host opportunity at which a replay
     * can observe a walk entry captured under the other policy, because the
     * only thing that can observe one is the subloop, and the subloop is not
     * running at that boundary.

     * SCOPE_LEVEL, in the CAMERA domain -- and the choice of LEVEL over LIVE is
     * the one scope decision here that is not forced by a safety argument, so
     * it is worth being exact about which argument it IS.
     *
     * The setting was RESTART because game/src/camera_obstruction_runtime.c
     * resolved MDKR_CAMERA_OBSTRUCTION with no way for anything but a relaunch
     * to change what it read; the launcher exports the resolved value onto that
     * same variable before engine entry (platform/app/engine_boot.cpp), so a
     * value set here and a value set in the environment reach the runtime
     * through one seam. That seam now has a setter beside it
     * (camera_obstruction_runtime_set_policy) and the env read is the fallback,
     * so "relaunch the whole app" is no longer the honest answer.
     *
     * NOT LIVE, for two reasons, neither of which is memory safety:
     *
     *   1. The obstruction runtime's only proven re-init is
     *      camera_obstruction_runtime_reset(), and every existing caller of it
     *      is a level boundary (thread3_main.c, before cam_init()). Reusing it
     *      there costs nothing and inherits a path the camera suite already
     *      covers. Mid-race it would zero live state -- presentation_depth,
     *      viewport_slot_valid, last_physical_slot_by_viewport -- whose
     *      invariants are maintained across the render's begin/end scope, and
     *      the value of proving that at a new boundary is nil, because:
     *   2. A policy flip is a HARD CUT of the rendered eye. The resolver's
     *      whole retract/recovery design (RELEASE_HOLD_TICKS, the transition
     *      cut census, the discontinuity flag) exists so the corrected camera
     *      never teleports, and it has no path that fades between two
     *      policies. A level load is the one moment the game already cuts the
     *      camera, so applying there is not a compromise -- it is the only
     *      moment the change is invisible.
     *
     * The player-facing cost of LEVEL over LIVE is a menu transition, and the
     * thing that actually mattered -- that choosing a camera should not mean
     * quitting the app -- is delivered either way.

     * carry -- that the display connection is set up once at launch -- was only
     * ever half true, and the half that was true stopped being true in M3:
     *
     *   - The WebGPU swapchain does bake its present mode at surface
     *     configuration, but gfx_webgpu_request_surface_reconfigure() already
     *     exists to re-rank it, because a display change invalidates the same
     *     ranking for reasons that have nothing to do with this key.
     *   - The GL swap interval is not fixed at context adoption at all.
     *     sdl_apply_gl_present_policy() is a plain SDL_GL_SetSwapInterval call
     *     that an existing context accepts at any time; it was simply only ever
     *     called once.
     *
     * Both are re-applied by the domain's boundary applier. Tearing rides with

     * mode is a function of policy AND tearing together (platform_sdl_min.c's
     * platform_present_display_quantum_units consults both), so re-ranking one
     * without the other would leave the pacer projecting onto a vblank the
     * backend is no longer waiting for.
