/*
 * sim_hash.c — authoritative-state hash.
 *
 * One 64-bit FNV-1a hash per authoritative tick over a VERSIONED field
 * stream. This is the anchor instrument for every later fidelity gate:
 * render purity, the presentation-rate matrix and catch-up equivalence
 * are all "the [SIMHASH] stream is identical" assertions.
 *
 * SELECTING A VERSION. MDKR_STATE_HASH picks the field set:
 *
 *   unset / "0"  off (zero cost beyond one cached getenv)
 *   "1"          v1 — the original field set, byte-for-byte
 *   "2"          v2 — archived object/particle integrator field set
 *   "2x"         legacy v2 render-owned diagnostic
 *   "3"          v3 — the current authority and render-purity gate
 *
 * Any other non-empty value is v1, so every log and script written before
 * v2 existed keeps its exact meaning and a cross-version A/B against an
 * archived stream stays possible. The version number is folded into the
 * hash as its first input, so two versions can never produce a colliding
 * stream that would let an A/B silently compare unlike things.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * v1 (SIM_HASH_VERSION_V1) — retained verbatim
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   - the gameplay RNG seed (the most divergence-sensitive scalar);
 *   - the live object count; and
 *   - per-object: behaviour id, position, Y ROTATION ONLY, and scale,
 *     read bitwise so float identity is exact.
 *
 * v1's y-rotation-only coverage is a measured blind spot, not a
 * theoretical one. On level 37 a line particle's x_rotation and
 * z_rotation diverged between two runs of the same binary at tick 3378 and
 * v1 could not see it until the drift had accumulated through
 * angularVelocity into y_rotation at tick 3381 — three ticks downstream of
 * the actual event. The [HASHOBJW] diagnostic row reads those fields by
 * hand; v2 is that row promoted into the hash.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * v2 (SIM_HASH_VERSION_V2) — a strict superset of v1
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Every byte v1 hashes, v2 hashes too, so v2 detects everything v1
 * detects. Global inputs are unchanged: version, RNG seed, object count.
 *
 * The object list is MIXED: particles live in gObjPtrList alongside
 * objects and are flagged OBJ_FLAGS_PARTICLE (objects.c:2964). Object and
 * Particle share ObjectTransform and, on LP64 as on the N64, are both
 * pointer-free through offset 0x3C, so their first 0x3C bytes are the
 * same layout with different names. v2 hashes that shared prefix for
 * every entry and then branches, so each entry is read as what it
 * actually is:
 *
 *   shared prefix (Object name / Particle name)
 *     trans.rotation.x_rotation                        NEW in v2
 *     trans.rotation.y_rotation                        (v1)
 *     trans.rotation.z_rotation                        NEW in v2
 *     trans.flags                                      NEW in v2
 *     trans.scale                                      (v1)
 *     trans.x_position / y_position / z_position       (v1)
 *     animFrame        / textureFrame       (0x18)     NEW in v2
 *     numActiveEmitters/ textureFrameStep   (0x1A)     NEW in v2
 *     x_velocity       / velocity.x         (0x1C)     NEW in v2
 *     y_velocity       / velocity.y         (0x20)     NEW in v2
 *     z_velocity       / velocity.z         (0x24)     NEW in v2
 *     unk28            / scaleVelocity      (0x28)     NEW in v2
 *     headerType       / kind               (0x2C)     NEW in v2
 *     segmentID        / segmentID          (0x2E)     NEW in v2
 *
 *   non-particle Object only
 *     behaviorId                                       (v1)
 *     objectID                                         NEW in v2
 *     animationID                                      NEW in v2
 *
 *   Particle only
 *     movementType, destroyTimer, descFlags            NEW in v2
 *     localPos.x / .y / .z                             NEW in v2
 *     opacity, opacityVel, opacityTimer                NEW in v2
 *     angularVelocity.x / .y / .z                      NEW in v2
 *     the gravity / line-phase union word              NEW in v2
 *
 * v1 hashed `object->behaviorId` for particles too, which on LP64 lands
 * on Particle::unk_48 — a byte v2 no longer reads under that name. It is
 * still a superset in the sense that matters: v2 covers every particle
 * field that byte could have witnessed a change in, and many more, so no
 * divergence v1 can see is invisible to v2. Verified by running both
 * versions over the same sweep.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Historical v2 exclusions
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Excluded by design and unchanged from v1: pointers, allocation
 * addresses, renderer caches, display lists, GPU handles, audio queue
 * fill, wall-clock values, presentation snapshots. Particle::parentObj,
 * ::model/::sprite and the ::lineEmitter arm of the movementParam union
 * are all host pointers on LP64 and are excluded on exactly that ground —
 * hashing them would make the stream a function of the memory map. This
 * is not hypothetical: the level-37 divergence above was recycled pointer
 * bytes reaching an authoritative field.
 *
 * v2 excluded these because they were render-owned at the time:
 *
 *   Object::distanceToCamera  written by sort_objects_by_dist
 *                             (objects.c:6332/6347/6349/6352/6358)
 *   Object::opacity           written by render_3d_billboard
 *                             (objects.c:4726/4728) and
 *                             check_if_in_draw_range (tracks.c:2748…)
 *   Object::modelIndex        LOD, written by set_temp_model_transforms
 *                             (objects.c:5562)
 *
 * Excluded because they are PRESENTATION-only — stored in a simulation
 * struct, but read by nothing except the display-list builder:
 *
 *   Particle::colour      feeds gDPSetEnvColor / vertex colour
 *   Particle::brightness  feeds gDPSetPrimColor (particles.c:2598/2637/
 *                         2654); the ONLY writes are the three
 *                         constructors, the ONLY reads are those three
 *                         gDPSetPrimColor calls plus two `!= 255` guards
 *
 * brightness is worth its own paragraph, because it is not merely
 * unhashed — it is hashed-and-then-removed, and the reason is measured.
 * It is seeded at construction from `obj->shading->unk0 * 255.0f`, and
 * shading->unk0 is written on the RENDER path: shadow_update()
 * (tracks.c:5065 and the :4918 accumulator) is called from render_scene
 * (tracks.c:461). So a particle born on a tick whose render was skipped
 * captures a different brightness than one born on a rendered tick. With
 * brightness in the set, the render-purity skip-odd arm went red on level
 * 5 at tick 3410, four particles at once (list indices 123-126, kinds 3
 * and 128), br=199 against br=255 — a real render→state coupling,
 * correctly detected. It is left as a known gap rather than fixed here
 * because the field it corrupts is one nothing in the simulation reads:
 * the consequence is a particle drawn at the wrong brightness, which is a
 * presentation-fidelity bug in the same family as `colour`, not an
 * authoritative-state bug. Putting it in the authoritative hash would
 * assert that render lighting IS authoritative state, which is false.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * v3 (SIM_HASH_VERSION_V3) — current gate
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * v3 retains v2 and adds, field-by-field with no host pointer bytes:
 *
 *   - game mode, level/load/race timers, pause/countdown and save flags;
 *   - Settings progression, racer records, course/flap time records,
 *     time-trial state, course flags and world balloon counts;
 *   - stable object-list index/presence, distanceToCamera, unk34/unk38,
 *     opacity, modelIndex, particle-emitter enable state and interactions;
 *   - scalar members of the behavior-selected ObjProperties arm;
 *   - Object_Racer gameplay fields (including physics, route/lap, inventory,
 *     timers, AI/controller state and animation controls); and
 *   - scalar animation state for every ModelInstance of real 3D-model objects,
 *     including dormant LODs that can become authoritative later.
 *
 * The former render-owned trio is now valid authority: distance/order and
 * racer LOD are committed once by the fixed tick, while per-viewport distance,
 * opacity and LOD are draw-local overrides. Model animation cadence is likewise
 * committed in the fixed-step epilogue. Raw normal-vs-skip render schedules are
 * byte-identical under v3; no test-only state subtraction exists.
 *
 * Deliberate v3 exclusions are pointers/addresses, display lists and renderer
 * caches, GPU/audio queue/wall-clock state, presentation snapshots, particle
 * colour/brightness, shading, and Object_Racer::lightFlags. lightFlags is the
 * brake/headlight texture state machine; its NIGHT bit samples render-computed
 * shading and no physics, AI, progression or input path consumes it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Playable-Taj sidecar state — a deliberate v3 exclusion
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * game/src/taj_physics.c keeps a per-racer sidecar (dashTicks, cooldownTicks,
 * entrySpeed, wasDrifting, selected) and game/src/taj_mod.c keeps the identity
 * masks (player_mask, racer_mask). None of it is hashed. It is not hashed
 * because it is not independently observable: every one of these values reaches
 * the hash through racer velocity ON THE SAME TICK it is read.
 *
 *   player_mask / racer_mask   taj_physics_is_taj() gates
 *                              taj_physics_pre/post_vehicle_update, so a
 *                              divergent mask means a racer is or is not
 *                              speed-clamped, attack-immune and dash-capable
 *                              in that same update_player_racer() call.
 *   entrySpeed / wasDrifting   read and consumed inside the same
 *                              taj_physics_post_vehicle_update().
 *   dashTicks                  taj_physics_advance_dash() runs before the
 *                              speed solve in the same call, and a nonzero
 *                              dashTicks both adds TAJ_PHYSICS_DASH_ACCELERATION
 *                              and raises maxSpeed, so it lands in
 *                              racer->velocity and Object::x/z_velocity —
 *                              all hashed — on the tick it changes.
 *
 * The one value with real detection latency is cooldownTicks. While it counts
 * down it changes nothing observable; a divergence in it is invisible until the
 * next drift release, which it then allows or refuses — and THAT shows up as a
 * dashTicks/velocity difference on the tick it happens. So the gap is bounded
 * by "until the next drift release", not unbounded, and the divergence is still
 * caught by the same [SIMHASH] stream when it becomes real.
 *
 * They are excluded rather than added because adding them would rewrite the
 * published byte stream for EVERY run — including the ordinary non-Taj runs the
 * determinism and render-purity gates compare — to cover a value that is
 * already covered one hop downstream. The presentation-object exclusion below
 * is a correction to what the stream means; this would only be a re-baseline.
 *
 * `tests/check_state_hash.py` independently perturbs every v3 family for one
 * sample and proves exact restoration. `tests/check_render_purity.py` compares
 * raw schedules and uses an explicit injected leak as its positive control.

 * READABLE FIELD ALIASES
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The field streams below are the authoritative-state contract, and most of
 * Object_Racer is still spelled `unkNN` by the decomp — an offset, not a name.
 * A stream of ~90 consecutive `unkNN` lines is unreviewable: nobody can tell
 * whether a field belongs in the hash, or notice one going missing.
 *
 * These aliases expand to the raw member token, so `SIM_HASH_FIELD(h, racer,
 * RACER_STUCK_TIMER)` is textually identical to the old `unk213` form after
 * preprocessing. THIS LAYER CANNOT CHANGE THE HASH: it renames nothing in the
 * struct, reorders nothing, and adds and removes no field. Byte-identity of the
 * v3 stream was measured before and after, not assumed.
 *
 * Meanings are derived from how game/src actually reads and writes each field,
 * and the confidence is recorded honestly:
 *
 *   plain name          the usage is unambiguous (a value set to N and counted
 *                       down while gating an effect is that effect's timer)
 *   "~" in the comment  suggestive but not conclusive — the name is the best
 *                       available reading, not an established fact
 *   *_UNIDENTIFIED_*    no usable evidence: the field is written and read
 *                       nowhere in this tree, or only copied around. These are
 *                       named by type and offset ON PURPOSE. Do not replace one
 *                       with a plausible-sounding guess; upstream has not named
 *                       them either, and a wrong name here is worse than none.
 *
 * The aliases are #undef'd after the last stream that uses them, so they cannot
 * leak into anything else in this file.

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * PRESENTATION-OBJECT EXCLUSION
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * gObjPtrList is not purely authoritative. A port feature may compose an
 * object that exists ONLY to be drawn: it owns no racer, AI, collision,
 * progression or input state, nothing in the simulation reads it back, and it
 * is free to be transformed from presentational sources. The playable-Taj
 * magic-carpet/rider companions (game/src/taj_visual.c) are the first such
 * objects: their trans.scale, trans.rotation.z_rotation and animFrame are
 * rewritten every tick from a bob phase and a dash pulse, three of those
 * inputs sit behind MDKR_TAJ_VISUAL_* environment flags, and whether they
 * exist at all depends on allocation success.
 *
 * Hashing them would assert that presentation IS authoritative state, which is
 * false, and it would make the anchor instrument a function of an environment
 * variable and of the allocator. That is the same argument that keeps
 * Particle::colour, ::brightness and Object_Racer::lightFlags out of v3 -- the
 * difference is only that here the whole object, not one field, is
 * presentational, so the exclusion is applied once at the walk instead of
 * field by field.
 *
 * ONE MECHANISM, FILTER SIDE. Every object walk in this file -- v1, v2, v3, the
 * family digests, both diagnostic dumps and the perturbation control -- passes
 * each entry through sim_hash_object_is_presentation() and skips it whole: no
 * index byte, no presence byte, no fields. The producing module does not get to
 * decide what the hash sees; it only answers "is this object mine". A future
 * presentation-only object joins by extending this one predicate.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT CHANGE. A skipped entry does not renumber its neighbours:
 * the surviving objects keep their gObjPtrList index, so a run that composes no
 * presentation objects produces a byte-identical stream to the one it produced
 * before this filter existed. The published count is likewise the authoritative
 * count, so a companion that fails to allocate no longer moves `objs=`.
 *
 * RESIDUAL, STATED PLAINLY. Companions still occupy list slots, so in a run
 * that composes them a LATER ordinary object can receive a different
 * gObjPtrList index than it would in a companion-free run, and the stream
 * differs on that ground. That is not a presentation leak: slot assignment is a
 * deterministic function of authoritative state (which players selected Taj,
 * which racers are live) and of the level, never of the render schedule, the
 * presentation cadence or the MDKR_TAJ_VISUAL_* flags -- which is exactly the
 * invariance tests/check_state_hash.py mutation-proves.
