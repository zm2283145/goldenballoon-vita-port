/**
 * video_config.h — video/presentation policy for the native port.
 *
 * The pure half of this module (schema, defaults, presets, precedence,
 * resolution) reads no globals and no environment, so tests/test_video_config.c
 * exercises it without a ROM, a window, or a GPU — the same seam
 * display_config.h uses.
 *
 * The impure half (mdkr_video_config_init / _publish / _report) reads the ini
 * file, the environment and argv, then publishes into the g_pc* globals the
 * fast3d backends link against and into display_config's widescreen/aspect
 * state.
 *
 * Three presentation modes:
 *
 *   pure        the original game presented honestly — authentic 4:3 framing at
 *               the authored FOV, zero enhancements. The oracle reference.
 *   restored    the default: original art direction at modern fidelity.
 *               Changes sharpness and stability, never the art direction.
 *   remastered  opt-in, work-in-progress art-directed effects on top of
 *               Restored.

 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A settings edit arrives from an ImGui draw inside the app
 * shell's overlay, which runs inside the engine's own frame — mid-present for
 * the WebGPU backend, and possibly inside a presentation subloop that is
 * already replaying a retained display list. Several receivers cannot be
 * rewritten there at any price: the present pacer has a latched policy and a
 * deadline grid derived from it, the presentation replay holds walk-entry
 * state (segment table included) that only gfx_dkr_replay_invalidate() clears,
 * and the camera obstruction sidecar holds a validated pose it will otherwise
 * keep reusing. Writing half of that under a running walk is how a stale
 * segment base becomes a wild pointer.
 *
 * THE SHAPE. The setter validates, persists, and updates the config
 * immediately — the player's choice is never in doubt and never lost. What it
 * defers is the hardware/engine-state consequence: it marks the owning domain
 * pending, and the engine calls mdkr_video_config_apply_pending() at the one
 * boundary that domain declared safe. The domain's callback then performs the
 * WHOLE apply as one ordered step. There is no partial state in between:
 * before the boundary everything runs on the old value, after it everything
 * runs on the new one.
 *
 * WHEN NOTHING IS REGISTERED. A domain with no callback is not deferred at
 * all — publish() writes it inline exactly as it always did. That is what
 * keeps the launcher-before-Play phase, --video-set, and every ROM-free test
 * working unchanged: they have no engine to defer to, and a value staged for a
 * boundary nobody services would silently never apply.
 */
