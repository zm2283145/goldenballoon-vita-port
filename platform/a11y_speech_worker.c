/* Barge-in. Throw the queue away, stamp the throw, then cut the engine off.

 * THE STAMP IS THE POINT, and the order alone is not enough. Emptying the queue
 * first does stop the worker picking up another line, but it says nothing about
 * the line already OUT of the queue: the worker pops under this mutex and only
 * calls _speak() after releasing it, so a purge landing in that gap finds
 * nothing to throw away and calls _stop() on an engine that has not started
 * talking yet. Both halves report success and the cancelled line is then spoken
 * in full, after the barge-in that was supposed to kill it. This comment used
 * to claim that ordering closed the window; it did not, and a wrong claim here
 * is worse than none because it tells the next reader not to look.
 *
 * WHAT THE STAMP CLOSES. The worker captures s_generation at the pop and
 * re-reads it, under the mutex, immediately before it speaks. A line whose
 * generation has moved is discarded rather than said. That covers the whole
 * pop-to-speak window including apply_voice(), which is two calls into the
 * backend and on at least one platform socket I/O to a daemon (see
 * a11y_speech_linux.c) — the widest and likeliest part of it.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT CLOSE, precisely. The worker's re-check and its _speak() are
 * not one atomic step. The mutex cannot be held across _speak(): that call
 * blocks for the length of a sentence, and the pump that pushes runs on the
 * render thread and would block behind it every frame. So a purge that lands
 * between the re-check's unlock and the engine actually taking the utterance
 * still finds an idle engine, still gets a no-op _stop(), and still lets that
 * one line through. The window is now a handful of instructions with no call in
 * it rather than one containing two backend round-trips, but it is not empty
 * and this file does not pretend otherwise.
 *
 * Closing it entirely means moving the arbitration to where _speak() and
 * _stop() actually meet, which is inside the backend: _stop() records the
 * generation it cancelled and _speak() tests it at the instant it commits the
 * utterance. That is a change to the a11y_speech.h contract and to five
 * backends, three of which have never been run by anyone (see the verification
 * table in that header) and a fourth of which cannot be exercised at all under
 * this project's MDKR_AUDIO=0 rule. It is deliberately not attempted here: a
 * narrowed race that is written down beats a wider one described as closed, and
 * it also beats new synchronisation in code nobody can run.
 *
 * _stop() is called with the mutex released — it may have to wait on a
 * synthesiser, and the worker needs the mutex to notice it has been cut off. */
