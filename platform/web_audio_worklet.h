/*
 * web_audio_worklet.h — web-only low-latency audio output backend for mdkr64.
 *
 * Vendored + adapted from mgb64/src/platform/web_audio_worklet.h. On the browser
 * the default SDL emscripten audio path is a MAIN-THREAD ScriptProcessorNode: the
 * once-per-frame pump AND the SPN callback both run on the main thread, so any GC
 * / WebGPU pipeline compile / level-load stall starves audio, forcing a deep
 * device buffer (a hard latency floor).
 *
 * This backend moves the DRAIN off the main thread: a plain-JS
 * AudioWorkletProcessor owns a ring buffer and pulls 128-sample render quanta at
 * audio-thread priority, immune to main-thread stalls. The engine still
 * synthesises on the main thread from mdkr64's independently due audio clock
 * and posts finished PCM into the ring via postMessage — so this
 * needs NO SharedArrayBuffer, NO cross-origin isolation, and does NOT touch the
 * WebGPU build. It is web-only and behind webAudioOutputActive(); if the browser
 * lacks AudioWorklet the caller falls back to the SDL emscripten audio path.
 *
 * mdkr64 feeds the SAME mixer sample buffers here as it feeds the native SDL
 * device (osAiSetNextBuffer in audi_port_dkr.c) — the leaf swap is at that sink.
