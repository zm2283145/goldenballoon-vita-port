/* enh_draw_distance.h — how far the world is drawn, and at what detail.
 *
 * Two settings live here, and both are declared MDKR_ENH_PRESENTATION in
 * platform/enhancement_registry.c. That declaration is the design constraint,
 * and for THIS enhancement it is a sharp one, because DKR's draw distance is
 * the kind of thing that is easy to move to the wrong side of the line.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT SIMPLY "RAISE THE THRESHOLD". The authored predicate is
 * check_if_in_draw_range() in game/src/tracks.c, and in this port it is called
 * from TWO places with completely different authority:
 *
 *   game/src/tracks.c scene_authoritative_render_tick()  — the FIXED TICK. It
 *       writes obj->opacity through that call, and obj->opacity is hashed by
 *       the [SIMHASH] v3 stream (platform/sim_hash.c). Admission there also
 *       gates obj_authoritative_texture_tick(). Widening the threshold here
 *       would make "how far you can see" an input to the simulation, which is
 *       the definition of a GAMEPLAY enhancement.
 *
 *   game/src/tracks.c render_level_geometry_and_objects()  — the DRAW. It
 *       replays the tick's per-viewport admission out of the route cache and
 *       writes nothing back.
 *
 * So the multiplier is threaded through the draw only, as a parameter, and the
 * tick keeps passing 1.0f — a value the arithmetic skips outright, so the
 * authoritative path is not merely equivalent to the authored one, it is the
 * same instructions. Nothing in this module writes to an Object.
 *
 * WHY IT IS LATCHED. The scale is read from the config once per drawn frame
 * (mdkr_enh_draw_distance_begin_frame) rather than per object. A live setting
 * that changed between two objects of the same frame would cull half a frame
 * at one radius and half at another, and the seam would move every frame.
