/* a11y_speech.h — the voice that reads platform/a11y_model.c out loud.
 *
 * a11y_model.c decides WHAT the app would say and keeps it as text. This layer
 * decides whether anything says it, and on which thread. The split is what lets
 * every accessibility gate assert behaviour with no audio device: the model's
 * `[SPEAK]` stream exists whether or not a backend ever comes up.
 *
 * TWO PIECES, AND THEY ARE NOT THE SAME PIECE.
 *
 *   The backend  — five functions, one implementation per platform, selected in
 *                  CMakeLists.txt exactly the way platform/app/file_dialog_* is.
 *                  It knows about a speech engine and nothing else.
 *   The worker   — a11y_speech_worker.c. One drain thread, one bounded handoff
 *                  queue, the MDKR_AUDIO refusal, and the live-config plumbing.
 *                  It is the ONLY caller of the backend.
 *
 * WHY A THREAD. A synthesiser call takes as long as the sentence takes to say.
 * On the render thread that is a multi-second stall, so the backend's _speak()
 * is deliberately allowed to block and is only ever called from the worker.
 *
 * WHY THE WORKER DOES NOT POP THE MODEL ITSELF. a11y_model.c is single-owner by
 * design and NOT an SPSC queue: mdkr_a11y_announce() writes s_head too, when a
 * full ring drops its oldest entry, so a push and a pop on two threads are a
 * genuine data race on the same indices, not a benign one. The push side lives
 * in platform/app/ui_common.cpp and cannot be locked from here. So the pop stays
 * on the thread that pushes — mdkr_a11y_speech_service_pump(), called once per
 * frame from the UI/render thread — and what crosses to the worker is a
 * mutex-guarded copy of the text. The frame pays one memcpy; the sentence is
 * spoken somewhere else.
 *
 * AUDIO SAFETY. MDKR_AUDIO=0 is the project's hard rule and a test run that
 * starts talking is exactly what it exists to prevent. The worker refuses to
 * bring a backend up at all under it, and every backend's _init() re-checks —
 * see mdkr_a11y_speech_audio_permitted() below. A refused run is not a broken
 * run: the app stays text-only and says so, once, on stderr.
 *
 * VERIFICATION STATUS OF THE BACKENDS, because an unverified backend that reads
 * as working is worse than no backend at all. Each file repeats its own line at
 * the top; the summary, as of the sprint that wrote them:
 *
 *   macOS    RUN. Speech produced and measured through a11y_speech_worker.c.
 *   Linux    COMPILED ONLY, by a real Linux gcc. Never run, so nobody has heard
 *            speech-dispatcher say anything.
 *   Windows  COMPILED ONLY, by x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++. Never run.
 *   Browser  COMPILED ONLY, by emcc. Never loaded in a browser, and nothing
 *            calls it yet — the wasm build has no app shell.
 *   Null     RUN, as the refusal path every MDKR_AUDIO=0 gate takes.
 *
 * Task 6 of the sprint owns docs/ACCESSIBILITY.md and the screen-reader route;
 * this comment is the record until it exists.
