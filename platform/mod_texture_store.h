/* mod_texture_store.h — decoded pack textures, keyed by content digest.
 *
 * The renderer asks this store one question, once per texture it is about to
 * upload: "does an installed pack supply this picture?". Everything else here
 * exists to make that question cheap enough to ask on a hot path and safe
 * enough to answer from files a stranger authored.
 *
 * Three properties the renderer relies on:
 *
 *   Inert until installed. With no registry, no packs, or overrides switched
 *   off, mdkr_mod_texture_lookup() returns 0 without touching the filesystem,
 *   and mdkr_mod_texture_store_active() reports so before the caller has even
 *   paid for a digest. A build with no mods/ directory must render exactly the
 *   bytes it rendered before this module existed.
 *
 *   Lazy and bounded. A pack's PNGs are decoded on first use, not at startup —
 *   a large pack would otherwise add seconds to launch for textures the player
 *   may never see. Decoded pixels are capped in total and the least recently
 *   used are dropped past the cap, so a 4K pack cannot quietly exhaust memory.
 *
 *   Quiet about the same failure twice. A PNG that will not decode is reported
 *   once, with its digest and the decoder's own reason, and is thereafter
 *   treated as absent. Re-reporting it would put a line in the log every frame
 *   the texture is bound.
 *
 * A separate, additive concern lives here too: with MDKR_MOD_TEXTURE_DUMP set,
 * mdkr_mod_texture_dump_observe() writes the digest-named PNG corpus
 * tools/mod_texture_dump.py's whole job depends on. It answers "what did the
 * game just draw", not "does a pack cover this", which is why it is a
 * question the renderer asks in addition to a lookup rather than a mode this
 * store's lookup path enters -- see mdkr_mod_texture_dump_active() below for
 * why it does not fold into mdkr_mod_texture_store_active().
 *
 * Single-threaded by standing decision (docs/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md §1: the
 * port is cooperative, with no real threads). There is deliberately no lock and
 * no atomic here; if that decision is ever revisited, this module is one of the
 * places that has to be revisited with it.

 * (a 16-bit texel becomes eight-bit channels and its one coverage bit becomes

 * declared before that clamp, so a reader can tell a truncated span from a
 * whole one by comparing the two rather than having to guess.
 *

 * buffer's, which for an installed override is the replacement's own size and

 * so the dumped PNG is what the game actually displays, not a re-decode this

 *
 * `width` and `height` describe THAT BUFFER and nothing else. When an override
 * applied they are the replacement's own size, which is NOT the logical tile
 * size the caller normalises texcoords against -- those diverge by design
 * (gfx_pc_dkr.c, issue #34), and passing the wrong one of the two encodes a
 * correct buffer at a wrong stride: in bounds, silently sheared, and only
 * visible with a pack installed AND the dump on. `fmt` and `siz` stay the

 * than the pixels written; they are the one pair here that is deliberately
 * not about `rgba`.

 * observed in the process; a no-op on every call after.
 *
 * Unconditionally a no-op unless MDKR_MOD_TEXTURE_DUMP is set: that is the
 * only cost this feature may impose when the variable is absent. Callers are
 * still expected to test mdkr_mod_texture_dump_active() before assembling the
