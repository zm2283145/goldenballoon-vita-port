/**
 * audi_port_dkr.c — native audio host driver for the mdkr64 (DKR) port.
 *
 * DKR's audio synthesizer runs natively; its Acmd output is executed inline by
 * platform/mixer.c (the abi.h a* macros are overridden — see platform/mixer.h).
 * The N64 audio thread (__amMain) never runs in the cooperative model, so this
 * file DRIVES synthesis synchronously from an independent fixed-ticket clock:
 *
 *   dkr_audio_advance_fields()  (called after one ordered game tick)
 *   dkr_audio_service_tick()    (called after one ordered game tick)
 *     -> consume at most one due two-field audio quantum
 *     -> pick its sample count (queue occupancy, or fixed deterministic count)
 *     -> amAudioSynthFrame(n)   (audiomgr.c: __clearAudioDMA + alAudioFrame ->
 *                                synthesis straight into an arena PCM buffer)
 *     -> osAiSetNextBuffer(buf, n*4)   (push to the host sink below)
 *
 * Host output is an SDL2 audio device in CALLBACK mode (stereo s16 @
 * OUTPUT_RATE), fed through the single-producer/single-consumer ring in
 * platform/audio_ring.c. The main loop only ever pushes; SDL's own audio thread
 * pulls. This is the native counterpart of the browser's AudioWorklet, and the
 * reason it is not SDL_QueueAudio is that queue mode pads any shortfall with
 * hard silence INSIDE SDL, so a dropout reaches the speaker as a pair of step
 * discontinuities the port cannot see or soften (issue #23). Owning the
 * consumer lets an underrun be crossfaded, and lets the latency controller be
 * driven by the drain the device really took rather than one inferred from
 * elapsed host time.
 *
 * Under --headless-frames the SDL device is not opened, but synthesis still
 * runs (so CI exercises the whole DSP path); set MDKR_AUDIO_DUMP=out.wav to
 * capture the PCM for RMS/peak validation, or MDKR_AUDIO_RMS=1 to print running
 * RMS/peak to stderr. MDKR_AUDIO_SINK_DUMP=accepted.wav is a separate native
 * diagnostic that records post-recovery PCM the sink accepted INTO THE OUTPUT
 * RING. That is deliberately a record of acceptance, not of playback: a block
 * the ring later overwrites on overflow still appears in the capture, because
 * the overwrite happens after the fact and is accounted by the ring's own
 * evicted_frames/overflows rather than by rewriting history here.
 *
 * MDKR_AUDIO_RMS=1 additionally emits one
 *
 *   [AUDIO] music seq=<id> tempo=<bpm> playing=<0|1> at sample=<n>
 *
 * line every time the sequence player's programmed tempo or sequence changes,
 * where <n> is the sample-frame offset into the MDKR_AUDIO_DUMP capture at which
 * the change took effect. tests/check_audio_output.py uses it to window its beat
 * measurement to a constant-tempo stretch and to compare the *measured* beat
 * period in the PCM against the BPM the sequencer says it programmed — the PCM
 * alone cannot tell "the synth is running" from "the synth is running at the
 * wrong rate".
 *
 * The same validation mode reports RAW16 loader calls/bytes and the first output
 * block containing one. tests/check_raw16_audio.py pairs that reachability
 * evidence with fixed-vs-legacy PCM captures and an independent ROM-bank decode.
