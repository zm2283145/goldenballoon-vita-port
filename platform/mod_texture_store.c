/**
 * mod_texture_store.c — see mod_texture_store.h.
 *
 * The store is one open-addressed table keyed by the 32-hex content digest.
 * Every digest the renderer ever asks about gets a slot, including the ones no
 * pack provides, because the overwhelmingly common answer is "no" and answering
 * it from a filesystem probe every time a texture missed the GPU cache would
 * cost far more than the slot does. A slot is therefore a decision that has
 * already been made, not just a cache of pixels:
 *
 *   SLOT_UNRESOLVED — the digest is known, its answer is not yet (a fresh slot,
 *                     or one whose pixels were evicted and must be decoded
 *                     again if it is wanted).
 *   SLOT_ABSENT     — no enabled pack holds textures/<digest>.png.
 *   SLOT_REJECTED   — a pack holds it, but it could not be used. Already
 *                     reported, once, and never retried.
 *   SLOT_RESIDENT   — decoded RGBA8 held in `rgba`.
 *
 * Only SLOT_RESIDENT ever transitions backwards (to SLOT_UNRESOLVED, when it is
 * evicted). That is what makes "report a bad PNG once" true by construction
 * rather than by a separate flag that could drift out of step with the state.
 *
 * Eviction picks the least recently used resident slot by a linear scan. That
 * is O(table) per eviction, deliberately: eviction only happens once the cache
 * is holding half a gigabyte of pixels, and a scan of a few thousand slots at
 * that point is invisible next to the PNG decode that triggered it. A heap or
 * an intrusive LRU list would be more code to be wrong in for no measurable
 * gain.
 *
 * Single-threaded; see the header. No lock, by standing decision.
