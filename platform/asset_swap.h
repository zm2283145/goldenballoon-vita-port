/**
 * asset_swap.h  —  Asset endianness-normalization layer for mdkr64.
 *
 * Diddy Kong Racing ships its assets big-endian (N64/MIPS). mdkr64 runs on a
 * little-endian host. Per PLAN.md decision #7 ("normalize at the asset-load
 * boundary"), every multi-byte field of every asset is byte-swapped to native
 * order *once*, right after the asset lands in RAM. Everything downstream — the
 * game logic and the F3DDKR HLE — then sees native-endian data and needs no
 * further swapping.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 *  WHAT GETS SWAPPED
 * ============================================================================
 *  - Struct/header fields that the game reads as multi-byte scalars
 *    (offsets-to-be-patched, counts, s16/s32/u16/u32/f32 values).
 *  - Vertex xyz (s16), Triangle UVs (s16), TriangleBatchInfo offsets+flags,
 *    TextureInfo ids, model/level-model/object-header internal offset tables.
 *
 *  WHAT STAYS UNSWAPPED (deliberately — verified against mgb64 gfx_pc):
 *  - Raw N64 texel payloads (RGBA16, RGBA32, IA and I and CI image bytes). These
 *    formats are byte-order-defined; the HLE texture uploader consumes them
 *    as-is. Only the TextureHeader in front of them is swapped.
 *  - CI4/CI8 TLUT palette data (RGBA16 texels, loaded from ASSET_EMPTY_14).
 *  - The 4 index/flag bytes at the head of each Triangle (flags,vi0,vi1,vi2)
 *    — the game reads them as individual bytes (Triangle.verticesArray / .flags),
 *    never as the disk-loaded u32 union, so they must NOT be swapped.
 *  - char[] names, ASCII/game-text/menu-text/level-name string blobs.
 *  - NOTE: DKR assets embed NO raw Gfx display lists. All F3DDKR command lists
 *    are built at runtime from the Vertex/Triangle/Batch arrays (rcp_dkr.c) and
 *    from runtime-built TextureHeader.cmd lists — so there are no on-disk
 *    two-word Gfx commands to u32-swap in any asset. (Contrast PLAN's generic
 *    note about DL words; it does not apply to DKR's asset payloads.)
 *
 * ============================================================================
 *  GZIP ORDERING (IMPORTANT)
 * ============================================================================
 *  Several sections are stored gzip-compressed in ROM. The swap operates on the
 *  DECOMPRESSED, typed bytes — it must run *after* gzip_inflate(), never on the
 *  compressed stream. The gzip stream's own little-endian length header is
 *  handled by game code (gzip.c byteswap32 / asset_table_load_zipped) and is
 *  NOT this layer's concern. Compressed section types: ASSET_OBJECT_MODELS,
 *  ASSET_OBJECT_ANIMATIONS, ASSET_LEVEL_MODELS, ASSET_LEVEL_OBJECT_MAPS, and
 *  compressed entries of ASSET_TEXTURES_2D/3D.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 *  INTEGRATION CONTRACT  (owner of asset_loading.c wires these in; do not edit
 *  asset_loading.c from this module)
 * ============================================================================
 *  The buffer handed to asset_swap_normalize() must be the RAW N64-layout image
 *  as just materialized in RAM (4-byte pointer/offset fields still present),
 *  BEFORE the game patches any internal offset into a host pointer. Call sites:
 *
 *   1. pi_init() (asset_loading.c): after the dmacopy that fills
 *      gAssetsLookupTable, call
 *          asset_swap_lut(gAssetsLookupTable, assetTableSize);
 *      This is the master asset LUT (array of u32 rom offsets).
 *
 *   2. asset_table_load(assetIndex) (asset_loading.c): this is the single
 *      primary hook. Just before `return out;`, call
 *          asset_swap_normalize(assetIndex, out, size);
 *      It normalizes every section that is loaded wholesale (all *_TABLE
 *      offset tables, FONTS, PARTICLES, PARTICLE_BEHAVIORS, the *_IDS lists,
 *      LEVEL_OBJECT_TRANSLATION_TABLE, TTGHOSTS_TABLE, WEATHER_PARTICLES, MISC,
 *      etc.). Dispatch keys off the AssetSectionsEnum value in `assetIndex`.
 *
 *   3. Gzip-compressed / whole-record loads that go through asset_load() in
 *      callers (asset_load only ever sees the still-compressed or partial
 *      bytes, so the swap CANNOT live inside asset_load). Add one call right
 *      after the data is fully materialized, passing the section enum + the
 *      decompressed byte size:
 *        - object_models.c  ~after gzip_inflate(...objMdl):        ASSET_OBJECT_MODELS
 *        - object_models.c  ~after gzip_inflate(...anim): call
 *              asset_swap_object_animation(anim, size,
 *                                          model->numberOfAnimatedVertices)
 *              (NOT the generic normalize — the blob lacks the vertex count)
 *        - tracks.c         ~after gzip_inflate(...gCurrentLevelModel): ASSET_LEVEL_MODELS
 *        - objects.c        ~after gzip_inflate(...mem) [obj map]: ASSET_LEVEL_OBJECT_MAPS
 *        - textures_sprites.c ~after load/inflate of TextureHeader: ASSET_TEXTURES_2D / _3D
 *        - game.c           ~after asset_load(ASSET_LEVEL_HEADERS): ASSET_LEVEL_HEADERS
 *        - objects.c        ~after asset_load(ASSET_OBJECTS) hdr:   ASSET_OBJECTS
 *        - textures_sprites.c ~after asset_load(ASSET_SPRITES):     ASSET_SPRITES
 *        - game_text.c      ~after asset_load(ASSET_GAME_TEXT_TABLE): ASSET_GAME_TEXT_TABLE
 *
 *  Idempotency: asset_swap_normalize() is NOT idempotent (swapping twice
 *  un-swaps). Call it exactly once per materialized asset. Sub-range partial
 *  loads (e.g. the throwaway TempTexHeader probe, CI-palette loads, game-text
 *  string bodies) must NOT be routed through it — see notes doc.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 *  PUNTED / PARTIAL (see docs/asset_swap_notes.md for the full table)
 * ============================================================================
 *  - ASSET_AUDIO: heterogeneous and owned by typed consumers. Bank/sequence
 *    images use explicit BE parsers, SoundData and MIDI headers convert at
 *    their call sites, raw samples/event streams remain byte-oriented, and
 *    VehicleSoundAsset records use asset_swap_vehicle_sound().
 *  - ASSET_LEVEL_OBJECT_MAPS: partial (file header + per-entry x/y/z; per-
 *    behavior body params punted).
 *  - ASSET_MISC, ASSET_JAPANESE_FONTS*: punted (heterogeneous / not used by
 *    us_v80). ASSET_SCREENS / ASSET_EMPTY_14: no-op (texel/palette data).
 *    ASSET_MISC sub-assets are normalized individually where their type becomes
 *    knowable: asset_swap_misc_lightdata() (LevelHeader_70),
 *    asset_swap_misc_boost() (sub-asset 20, Object_Boost[]) and
 *    objects.c dkr_misc_swap_words() (plain 32-bit-word arrays).
