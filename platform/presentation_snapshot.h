/*
 * presentation_snapshot.h — native-only presentation shadow state
 * (spec §7, Phase 3 Wave A).
 *
 * The authoritative simulation runs in fixed original-region quanta; the
 * host presents at whatever rate it likes. To draw an intermediate frame the
 * renderer needs the two bracketing authoritative poses — and it must get
 * them WITHOUT reading (or writing) live game objects, because §4.5 forbids
 * presentation from touching authoritative state and §4.2 forbids rendering
 * from mutating it.
 *
 * This module is that shadow store. It contains NO original N64 struct: the
 * game's layouts are untouched, and every field here is a copy taken at the
 * authoritative tick boundary.
 *
 * THE IDENTITY PROBLEM (the reason this module is not just "two arrays of
 * transforms"). DKR allocates objects from a fixed 512-slot pool
 * (OBJECT_SLOT_COUNT) and recycles addresses aggressively — a banana freed
 * on tick N is very often the exact address a weapon spawns into on tick
 * N+1. Keyed on `Object *` alone, the interpolator would happily blend the
 * banana's last pose into the weapon's first pose and draw a projectile
 * flying in from wherever the fruit died. So entries are keyed by
 *
 *     identity = (Object * address, monotonically increasing spawn generation)
 *
 * where the generation is issued by presentation_snapshot_note_spawn() at
 * the real lifecycle sites in objects.c (spawn_object's success return and
 * add_particle_to_entity_list) and retired by
 * presentation_snapshot_note_free() at obj_destroy(), the single point where
 * an Object's memory actually goes back to the pool. A recycled address gets
 * a fresh generation, the generations of the pair disagree, and the
 * interpolator refuses to pair them.
 *
 * PUBLISHING. The gfx_shadow_frame.c house pattern: capture_begin() stages,
 * capture_commit() publishes atomically, and consumers only ever see
 * immutable published data. The one difference is that consumers here need a
 * PAIR (previous, current) rather than a single frame, so the ring is three
 * slots deep: while slot k is being filled, the published previous/current
 * pair keeps both of its slots and does not move. A capture that overflows
 * fails whole — never partially — and the previously published pair is
 * retained (the shadow-frame retention rule).
 *
 * COST WHEN OFF. Everything is gated on presentation_snapshot_enabled(),
 * one cached getenv("MDKR_PRESENT_SNAPSHOT") behind a static int. The
 * lifecycle hooks in objects.c and the capture call in stubs_dkr.c are a
 * predictable load-and-branch when the seam is off. Wave C replaces the env
 * read with the real config key; the seam stays.

/* ---- authored UV-scroll rates ------------------------------------------- *
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. obj_loop_texscroll advances a level texture through a
 * TWO-BIT accumulator: it adds the authored rate (quarter-units per tick) to
 * `unk8`, emits `unk8 >> 2` whole units into the triangle UVs and keeps
 * `unk8 & 3` as the residue. An authored rate that is not a multiple of four
 * therefore emits ZERO units on some ticks and N on others, even though the
 * surface is scrolling at a perfectly constant speed.
 *
 * A presentation stage that recovers the speed by DIFFERENCING two authored
 * ticks cannot see through that quantisation. It reads 0 then N, and either
 * publishes nothing (a zero difference is not a scroll) or publishes two
 * disagreeing displacements — so the confirm-or-hold rule refuses, on every
 * present, forever. The surface keeps its 30 Hz texture cadence beside a
 * world drawn at the host rate, which is the shimmer the owner reported on
 * waterfalls, rivers and lava.
 *
 * The game does not have to be measured: it KNOWS the rate. This registry is
 * how it says so. Per authored tick, obj_loop_texscroll registers the address
 * span of every triangle batch it drives together with
 *
 *   rate  — the tick's authored advance in QUARTER units (rate * updateRate)
 *   phase — the accumulator residue BELONGING TO THE BYTES THE SPAN NOW HOLDS,
 *           i.e. `unk8` as it stood BEFORE this tick's advance
 *
 * from which presentation reconstructs the true sub-tick position exactly:
 *
 *   offset(alpha) = (phase + rate * alpha) / 4      [whole UV units]
 *
 * At alpha 1 that equals the emitted whole units plus the NEXT tick's phase,
 * so consecutive ticks join without a step: the quantisation cancels instead
 * of beating against the present rate. One observation is enough, so no
 * second tick has to confirm anything and the wrap rule that
 * gfx_presentation_packet_lookup_uv_scroll enforces for MEASURED scrollers is
 * left exactly as strict as it was.
 *
 * SCOPE. Only the texscroll driver registers. Every other UV mover (waves,
 * rain, the skydome, the texture animator's flipbooks) is untouched and still
 * goes through measurement and confirmation — a flipbook can never be
 * mistaken for a scroll here because it never appears in this table.
 *
 * LIFETIME. The table is filled during a game tick and consumed by the
 * following future-task walk, which clears it. A span registered twice while
 * the table is live is ambiguous (two scrollers driving one batch, or a tick
 * whose walk never ran) and is refused, falling back to measurement.
