/*
 * In-process local room for zero-internet Phone Party.
 *
 * This is the LAN equivalent of the Cloudflare Party room Durable Object
 * (services/party/src/party-room.ts + room-model.ts): it mints the invite
 * capability and fallback code, holds seat leases, and relays the pairing
 * protocol between two ends -- the phones (real WebSocket connections handed
 * over by MdkrLanPartyServer) and the native host (an in-process seam that
 * Task 3's LanPartyTransport drives). It speaks the EXACT wire protocol the
 * shipped controller page already talks, so the page needs no LAN-specific
 * message variant beyond its transport URL.
 *
 * SECURITY BOUNDARY -- anonymous until authenticated. The Task 1 server
 * validates the Host header but NOT Origin, so a cross-origin browser page
 * that knows this host's LAN ip:port can still complete the ws upgrade. The
 * upgraded socket therefore proves NOTHING. This room is the authentication
 * boundary: every freshly-attached controller socket is treated as
 * anonymous and hostile and does nothing -- it is not registered as a
 * controller, receives no room state, and cannot relay a single signal --
 * until it presents a valid capability or fallback code via a `redeem`
 * message. Anything else from an un-redeemed socket closes it (4001).
 *
 * THREADING. Controller socket callbacks (onMessage / onClosed) fire on the
 * server's connection threads; open()/deliverFromHost()/close()/invite()
 * are launcher-thread calls driven by the transport. All room state lives
 * under one mutex. Outbound work (socket sends, host-sink deliveries) is
 * collected under the lock and performed after releasing it, so no I/O runs
 * while the lock is held and a peer can never stall another delivery. The
 * host sink must follow the transport contract: copy into a bounded queue
 * and return, never call back into the launcher model synchronously.
