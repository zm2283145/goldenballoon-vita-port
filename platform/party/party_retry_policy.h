/*
 * Pure decision policy for native WebRTC signaling retry (defect C3).
 *
 * The Worker's signaling relay is fire-and-forget: an offer addressed to a
 * phone whose socket happens to be closed at that instant is silently
 * dropped, and a PeerConnection that never receives a remote description
 * never reaches Failed -- nothing else in the transport ever notices, and
 * the phone is stranded until a human removes and re-adds it.
 *
 * This is the pure decision half of the fix: given how old the outstanding
 * offer is, how many times it has already been sent, whether the peer has
 * finished the control-channel handshake, and whether the signaling socket
 * just came back, decide what the transport's tick()/createPeer() should do
 * next. It touches no transport state, no clock, and no socket, so the
 * policy is exercised directly by a unit test instead of only through a
 * live WebSocket/WebRTC stack.
 *
 * Policy (values are contractual -- update this comment and its test
 * together with any change):
 *  - An authenticated peer (one that has completed controller_ready) is
 *    never recreated by this policy: it is a live, connected phone.
 *  - A protocol-mismatched peer (one whose controller_ready declared a
 *    different pairing-protocol version, I2) is never this policy's
 *    business either: its offer WAS answered, so it is connected-but-
 *    wrong-version, not stranded, and no recreated peer, resent offer, or
 *    give-up can close a version gap. The recovery is the phone reloading
 *    into a matching page, which arrives as a fresh peer with the flag
 *    clear.
 *  - An unauthenticated peer whose outstanding offer has been unanswered
 *    for >= 20 s gets a fresh peer and a fresh offer (recreatePeer),
 *    unless it has already used all 3 attempts, in which case it gives up
 *    instead (giveUp) -- reported as an explicit per-controller error
 *    rather than silently hanging or tearing down the room.
 *  - A signaling socket that just reopened while a still-unauthenticated
 *    peer's offer is outstanding gets that same offer resent verbatim
 *    (resendOffer): the Worker dropped it because the socket was down, not
 *    because anything is wrong with the offer, so resending costs nothing
 *    and does not consume one of the 3 attempts.

/*
 * Signaling-socket resume policy (I4): the decision half of the transport's
 * reconnect ladder, including when to stop climbing it forever.
 *
 * A party room can be gone for good: its Durable Object's 24 h alarm ran
 * deleteAll, or its stored expiry passed (services/party/src/party-room.ts
 * rejects the resume upgrade with HTTP 404 in both cases), or the credential
 * can no longer validate (the Worker answers 401 before the room is even
 * consulted, services/party/src/worker.ts connect()). None of those states
 * ever heals within a session, yet the pre-fix ladder retried them every
 * <= 8 s forever.
 *
 * What the native side can actually SEE of that: libdatachannel folds every
 * HTTP-refused WebSocket upgrade -- whatever the status code -- into the one
 * onError string "WebSocket connection failed" (the non-101 status is
 * logged and swallowed, wshandshake.cpp/wstransport.cpp), and discards the
 * code and reason of typed close frames entirely. Network-level failures
 * are distinct strings ("TCP connection failed", "TLS connection failed",
 * "Connection timed out"). So the honest classification is not "reason ==
 * room_gone" but "the service itself answered this fresh handshake with a
 * refusal", counted consecutively:
 *
 *  - resumeRejected: this close followed the service refusing the resume
 *    upgrade with an HTTP response. False for live-socket drops and for
 *    network-level failures that never reached the service.
 *  - consecutiveResumeRejections: refused resumes since the last successful
 *    upgrade, including this one when resumeRejected is true. Network-level
 *    failures neither advance nor reset it (they proved nothing about the
 *    room); only a completed upgrade resets it.
 *  - reconnectAttempt: 1-based closes since the last successful upgrade,
 *    driving the existing 300 ms..8 s delay ladder, unchanged.
 *
 *  - nowMs / firstRejectedMs share the transport's one steady clock
 *    (steadyNowMs()), exactly like the offer policy's nowMs/offerSentMs.
 *    firstRejectedMs is when the standing streak's FIRST refusal was
 *    counted; 0 means no refusal streak is standing. It resets with the
 *    streak (a completed upgrade) and, like the streak, survives
 *    intervening network-level failures.
 *
 * Verdict (values are contractual -- update this comment and the test
 * together with any change): terminal requires ALL of
 *   (1) this close was itself a refusal (a network failure atop a standing
 *       streak proved nothing and can never be the deciding strike),
 *   (2) at least 3 consecutive refusals, and
 *   (3) the refusal streak has SPANNED at least 30 s of wall clock, first
 *       refusal to this deciding one.
 * The floor exists because libdatachannel swallows the HTTP status: a
 * correlated edge incident (5xx/429, a worker exception) refuses upgrades
 * exactly like a dead room's 404, and without the floor the streak
 * completes on the ladder's 600 + 1200 ms rungs -- every healthy room
 * would land RoomEnded ~2 s into a blip that recovers on its own. A dead
 * room refuses deterministically forever, so it can afford the wait: under
 * the 300 ms..8 s ladder the verdict now lands ~33 s after the room died
 * (refusals at ~0/0.3/0.9/2.1/4.5/9.3/17.3/25.3/33.3 s) instead of ~2 s.
 * Sub-30 s incidents ride the ladder and recover exactly as before this
 * policy existed. "Refusal" still includes the rare EOF-after-TLS-before-
 * the-101 middlebox shape -- one that does it persistently for 30 s has
 * made the room unusable anyway. Terminal means the ladder ends: no next
 * delay, no further socket opens, and the transport reports the room gone
 * so the host can offer a new invite (a brand-new room) as the way
 * forward. Everything else keeps the pre-existing bounded ladder: delays
 * 300 ms doubling to a 8000 ms cap.
