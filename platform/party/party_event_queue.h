/*
 * Bounded queue for MdkrPartyTransportEvent with a survivable overflow
 * policy.
 *
 * The transport's callbacks (WebSocket/WebRTC threads) publish events faster
 * than the launcher thread is guaranteed to drain them -- a minimized
 * window, an OS hiccup, anything that delays a service() call. Phones
 * heartbeat their pad state every 50 ms, so a pad-packet event is by far the
 * most common one and, by the Party pad protocol's own design, droppable: a
 * missed sample is just a gap the next sample fills. Room/control events
 * (RoomState, connect/disconnect, command results, errors) are not --
 * dropping one of those silently desyncs the host's view of the room from
 * the truth the service holds.
 *
 * This queue never grows past capacity, never clears itself, and never
 * fabricates an event. At capacity it evicts the oldest droppable event to
 * make room for the newest one; only in the (practically unreachable, but
 * still-handled) case where every queued event is non-droppable does it
 * fall back to evicting a same-typed non-droppable event, so the bound
 * holds unconditionally without ever destroying the whole backlog.
