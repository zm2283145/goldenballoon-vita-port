/*
 * Launcher-side configuration for zero-internet local play (Task 5).
 *
 * The LanPartyTransport (lan_party_transport.h) is configured at construction
 * with three things the launcher must supply: the LAN address the invite QR
 * encodes, the packaged controller assets the embedded server hands out, and
 * an ephemeral port. This module builds all three, and it fails closed: no LAN
 * address or no controller page means no local-play card.
 *
 * The two pure functions below (select-advertised-host and build-manifest) carry
 * the logic worth pinning and live in lan_party_launch.cpp with no dependency on
 * getifaddrs, the resource bundle, or SDL, so a unit test can exercise them
 * directly (tests/test_lan_party_launch.cpp). The two production wrappers
 * (advertised-host and build-launch-config) that reach the real machine
 * addresses and the packaged bundle live in lan_party_launch_config.cpp, which
 * only the app links -- ui_*.cpp has no unit harness, and neither does the glue
 * that resolves them.
