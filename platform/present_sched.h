/*
 * present_sched.h — presentation-side facade for the authoritative host-frame
 * driver.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. SimSched started as a parallel clock opinion and was
 * promoted only after its exact agreement gate passed. HostFrameDriver now
 * issues fixed-size game-loop tickets while this facade owns the presentation
 * controls, replay telemetry, and collapsed-libultra adapter API. Presentation
 * count may diverge from tick count; ticket width may not.
 *
 * THE CLOCK SOURCE. The accumulator is fed the pacer's own committed field
 * count (g_viLastWallFields), not a second reading of the host clock. Two
 * independent samples of CLOCK_MONOTONIC would disagree by the time spent
 * between them and the accumulator would slowly lead or lag the pacer for
 * reasons that have nothing to do with the design under test. Feeding the
 * pacer's committed count means any divergence this module reports is a real
 * modelling difference, not clock skew — and, because a field is exactly 1e9
 * accumulator units, the arithmetic is exact (see sim_sched_advance_units).
 *
 * MDKR_VI_PACE=off deliberately lies about updateRate (g_viLastFields becomes
 * 1) while leaving the true elapsed count in g_viLastWallFields. The
 * accumulator follows the TRUE count: it models wall time, not what the game
 * is told.
 *
 * COST OF TELEMETRY. Trace rows remain behind one cached getenv. The driver and
 * ticket adapter themselves are shipping clock policy, not diagnostics.

 *   displayed-interval  wall microseconds between consecutive frames that
 *                       actually reached the screen. A held (no-swap) present
 *                       is absent from this series by construction, so a run
 *                       that holds every other opportunity shows the doubled
 *                       interval the player sees rather than the pacer's even
 *                       one.
 *   alpha-delta         interpolation phase advanced between consecutive
 *                       DISPLAYED frames, in parts-per-million of one
 *                       authoritative tick. Even spacing here is what makes

 *
 * WHY A HISTOGRAM. A fixed bucket array is the only shape that yields p95/p99
 * in bounded memory: keeping samples would grow without limit across a session,
 * and a running mean cannot see the tail at all. The bins are linear so the
 * resolution is uniform where the interesting mass sits.

/* ---- Video.FrameLimit / Video.MotionSmoothing config push (Wave C) ------- *
 *
 * present_sched_present_rate() and present_sched_smoothing_enabled() above are
 * a CACHED-ONCE getenv by design (see "COST WHEN OFF"): an unarmed run pays
 * one getenv for the whole process. That is exactly what makes them unsafe to
 * treat as reread-every-frame config, and exactly why video_config_runtime.c
 * calls these two instead of relying on MDKR_PRESENT_RATE/MDKR_PRESENT_SMOOTHING
 * being set as real environment variables: setenv() after the first read would
 * not be seen at all. These overwrite the cached value directly, so the value
 * a config file / CLI flag / launcher / schema-recognised env var resolved
 * reaches the seam at boot, through the same mdkr_video_config_publish() hook
 * every other key uses.
 *
 * WHY THESE SETTERS ARE NOT, BY THEMSELVES, "LIVE". An early version of this
 * comment claimed they were -- that overwriting the cached ints made the keys
 * "genuinely LIVE, not merely read once at boot dressed up as LIVE". That was
 * wrong, and the reason is worth keeping: overwriting these two cached ints is
 * NECESSARY for a mid-run change to take effect and nowhere near SUFFICIENT,
 * because the consumers downstream of them latch. present_pace_lazy_init()
 * (platform_sdl_min.c) resolves the present policy once into its deadline state
 * and never revisits it, so engaging late costs the freeze/snapshot work with
 * no subloop to spend it on; and gfx_start_frame() stops refreshing
 * dkr_walk_entry_* the moment present_sched_replay_armed() goes false, while
 * the already-latched subloop keeps replaying -- memcpy'ing a stale segment
 * table into live HLE state.
 *
 * The keys ARE SCOPE_LIVE now, and none of the above stopped being true. What
 * changed is that these setters are no longer reachable from a settings panel
 * under a running engine at all. video_config.c's MDKR_VIDEO_APPLY_PRESENTATION
 * domain stages the change; platform_present_config_apply() calls these at the
 * host-frame boundary, after retiring the replay history and before re-latching
 * the pacer, as one ordered step. Calling them from anywhere else while the
 * engine runs would reintroduce exactly the hazard this paragraph describes.
 * See video_config.c's Video.FrameLimit row for the full argument.
 *
 * `value` is `original`, `display`, `uncapped`, or a validated integer cap
 * from 30 through 1000; smoothing is `off` or `interpolate`. Called only when
 * the resolved key did not come from the schema default (see
 * video_config_runtime.c), so an unset config still leaves the legacy raw-env
