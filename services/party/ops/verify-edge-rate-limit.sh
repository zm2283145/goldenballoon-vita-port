# Deploy-time assertion that the reviewed edge rate-limit rule is actually
# live on the zone. The Worker-side per-address create throttle is the
# code-enforced availability control; this zone rule is the hand-applied edge
# layer in front of it, and a hand-applied rule is exactly the kind that
# silently is not there. This script asks the Cloudflare Rulesets API for the
# zone's http_ratelimit entry point and requires a rule matching
# free-rate-limit-rule.json: same ref, enabled, same expression, action and
# rate-limit parameters.
#
# Credentials come from the environment only:
#   CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN  least-privilege token able to read zone WAF rules
#   CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID    the zone serving PARTY_DOMAIN
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  the rule is live and matches the reviewed payload
#   1  the rule is verifiably wrong: missing, disabled, or diverged. The zone
#      was reached and answered, and the reviewed rule is not in force.
#   2  credentials absent — an explicit refusal to claim success, so a
#      credential-less CI run can never report the rule as verified
#   3  the check could not run: the API was unreachable, returned non-JSON, or
#      refused the request (e.g. a token without the Zone WAF read scope). This
#      is "cannot verify", not "verifiably absent", so a caller can degrade it
#      to a warning instead of blocking a deploy on a credential/scope problem.
