// sw.js — offline cache for the published Golden Balloon shell.
//
// The page advertises itself as installable (fullscreen display mode, Add to
// Home Screen). An installed app that cannot start without the network is a
// broken promise, so the shell + engine are cached; nothing else about the
// page's behaviour changes.
//
// THE ONE INVARIANT: a cached JS/wasm pair must always come from ONE build.
// Mixing a new mdkr64_web.js against an old mdkr64_web.wasm (or an old shell
// against a new engine) is the exact failure the publisher's ?v=<commit> stamp
// exists to prevent, and a cache is the classic way to reintroduce it. Three
// rules together make that impossible:
//
//   1. This worker is registered as sw.js?v=<commit>, so its own identity IS
//      the build. BUILD below is read from that URL and names the cache.
//   2. A request is only served from (or written to) the cache when its ?v=
//      matches BUILD exactly. A request stamped for a different build is passed
//      straight to the network — this worker will not answer for it.
//   3. There is no skipWaiting() and no clients.claim(). A newer worker installs
//      alongside and takes over only once every document using this one has
//      gone, so a live page keeps the worker whose cache matches the HTML it
//      actually loaded. Activation then deletes every other build's cache.
//
// The document itself carries no stamp (it is what CONTAINS the stamps), so it
// is network-first: a publish is picked up on the next load, and the cached copy
// is only a fallback for being offline.
//
// An unstamped registration (a local dev page) caches nothing and removes
// itself; a worker must never pin a half-edited working copy.

// online returns the network response regardless), but "the app opened on the
