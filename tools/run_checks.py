"""Run every registered mdkr64 regression check with the correct artifact.

The suite has five invocation shapes:

* ROM-free CTest targets use the selected native build directory;
* ordinary behavioural checks use the selected native build;
* optimisation- and sanitizer-specific checks use dedicated Release/ASan builds;
* structural checks inspect an instrumented build or the linked wasm directly;
* browser gates serve wasm modules to an isolated real Chromium profile.

This runner owns those differences and fails if a new ``tests/check_*.py`` is
not registered below, or if a ``tests/test_*.py`` has no CMake ``add_test()``
to carry it into the ctest task. Under ``--jobs`` the CPU-bound checks pool;
the roles that share a build tree or a local port, the render/GPU checks, and
the wall-clock measurement checks stay serial (see the SERIAL_ROLES /
GPU_SERIAL_NAMES / SERIAL_NAMES model below).

A bare ``python3 tools/run_checks.py`` runs the complete suite. There is no
human gate on testing: automation windows render hidden or ordered behind the
desktop by design (set ``MDKR_TEST_VISIBLE_HEADLESS=1`` to watch one), so a run
never seizes focus from interactive work, and bulk children are launched at
background scheduling priority (wall-clock measurement checks and the browser
lanes run foreground, one at a time -- see yield_wrapper). ``--with-app-tests``,
``--with-compiled-tests``, ``--with-browser-tests`` and ``--with-gpu-tests``
are accepted but ignored: those classes now run by default.

# --jobs serialization model.
#
# ``--jobs N`` pools CPU-bound tasks (each in its own save scratch) and keeps
# three disjoint classes sequential. ``--jobs 1`` is byte-for-byte the
# historical sequential runner.
#
#   1. SERIAL_ROLES — roles that share ONE build tree or bind fixed local
#      ports, so two of them cannot run at once no matter what they assert:
#      instrumented/layout are compiled in place, the wasm module is one
#      directory, and every browser lane serves dist/web and binds a local
#      port / spawns a Chromium profile / runs a local Worker. ``ctest`` is a
#      single broad compiled inventory (some tests GPU-labelled); it runs alone
#      after the pool drains rather than beside it. This set deliberately does
#      NOT include rom/native/release/asan — those roles pool, and only their
#      individual GPU/measurement checks are pulled out by name below. (An
#      earlier revision serialized all four wholesale, which put 192/210 tasks
#      back on the sequential path and erased the speedup.)
#
#   2. GPU_SERIAL_NAMES — rom/native/release/asan checks whose VERDICT reads
#      rendered pixels, drives a GPU surface/adapter, or otherwise contends for
#      the renderer. These flake under parallel GPU contention — the repo's
#      hard-won "GPU gates need a quiet machine" — so they serialize even though
#      their role pools. Every entry was classified by reading the check: it
#      captures a framebuffer, compares pixels, or opens a WebGPU adapter whose
#      census is the verdict. validate_manifest() re-derives the render-marker
#      set from the scripts and FAILS if a pooled engine check grows a pixel or
#      frame capture without being listed here — so a future render check
#      cannot silently rejoin the pool and reintroduce a flake.
#
#   3. SERIAL_NAMES — checks whose verdict is a wall-clock or host-load
#      measurement (realtime pacing arms, adopted-window handoffs, replay-cost
#      ceilings). Host contention turns those into false failures — the same
#      effect docs/TEST_SUITE_ECONOMICS.md §1 measured between its loaded and
#      quiet runs.
#
# Everything else pools: the CPU-bound native/rom/release/asan checks (audio,
# save, state-hash, input, rollback, numeric camera-geometry SIMHASH,
# progression) and the pure ``source`` checks. Their verdicts are deterministic
# functions of the ROM and inputs, independent of render timing, so a pooled
# run reproduces the sequential verdict byte-for-byte (the equivalence the
# economics doc requires before pooling an arm).

# validate_manifest() proves this set still covers every pixel/frame-capture
# check in a pooled role. Measurement-sensitive render checks (pacing_quality,
