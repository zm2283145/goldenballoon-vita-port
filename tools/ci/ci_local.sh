#
# ci_local.sh -- run the ROM-free CI gates locally.
#
# correctness.yml is hosted (push/PR/workflow_dispatch), but the release and
# validation lanes (release.yml, windows-validate.yml, macos-release.yml) are
# manual-only. This script is the one-command local mirror of the ROM-free
# gates: it runs what correctness.yml's `policy` job runs, needs no ROM or game
# data by default, and reports a single pass/fail summary.
#
# COVERED HERE: release/provenance hygiene, ignored-artifact hygiene, public
# shell tool syntax, documentation links, and a Release configure+build of the
# native port. On a caller-attested dedicated desktop, `--with-compiled-tests`
# adds the ROM-free CTest suite and `--with-gpu-tests` adds the native graphics
# lane no hosted runner can execute.
#
# DELIBERATELY NOT COVERED: the full ROM-gated regression battery
# (tools/run_checks.py, ~76 tasks across several dedicated build directories --
# build-rel, build-asan, a linked wasm build, and a real Chrome profile). It
# needs a legally-owned ROM the contributor supplies locally, takes much
# longer, and is sequential by design -- several checks create and remove
# save/eeprom.bin -- so it must not race a concurrent invocation on a shared
# checkout. It remains the owner-run pre-release gate documented in
# docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md; pass --with-rom-suite to also run it from here.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/ci/ci_local.sh [--build-dir DIR] [--no-build] [--jobs N]
#                        [--with-compiled-tests] [--with-gpu-tests]
#                        [--with-rom-suite [--rom PATH]]
#
# -e is safe here because every gate runs through step(), which invokes it as an
# `if` condition; a failing gate is scored, not fatal. -e only catches faults in
# this script's own control flow.
set -euo pipefail

# Bulk work yields to the interactive desktop by being LAUNCHED at background
# priority (yield_run below); the script itself keeps the invoking shell's
# priority. It used to demote its own pid (renice 15 plus the Darwin band),
# which every child inherited and none could give back -- including
# tools/run_checks.py, whose wall-clock measurement checks must run
# foreground, and the audio sink contract, whose drain accounting is
# wall-clock against a real device. On Apple Silicon the inherited Darwin
# background band confines all of it to the efficiency cores.
