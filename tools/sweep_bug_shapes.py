"""Mechanically enumerate three bug SHAPES across game/src and platform/ -- CONTRIBUTING.md rule 6.

Each of these three classes is invisible to every runtime instrument this project
owns, for a different reason, which is why the sweep has to be static:

  bare-pointer   A callee writes an unknown number of elements through a pointer
                 parameter that carries no count. UBSan `array-bounds` needs an
                 indexed *array type* to reason about and the callee only has a
                 pointer; ASan only helps if the overrun is reached, and the
                 measured peaks say none of them is. So the only way to know the
                 list is complete is to enumerate the signatures.
                 Worked instance: get_inside_segment_count_xz() writing into the
                 caller's segmentsInside[8] (docs/OPEN_ITEMS.md "splitsweep").

  equality-cap   A saturation cap tested with `==`/`!=` against a counter that can
                 be advanced past the boundary by a *second*, unguarded increment.
                 Nothing can see this until a level saturates the list, and then it
                 is a silent overrun, not a trap.
                 Worked instance: generate_collision_candidates()'s
                 `if (j == MAX_COLLISION_CANDIDATES)` (docs/OPEN_ITEMS.md
                 "gridmask").

  shift-count    A shift whose count is a variable that can reach or exceed the
                 width of the type. The decomp writes MIPS `sllv` -- which masks
                 the count to 5 bits -- as `1 << (j + 31)`, which is UB in C.
                 `-fsanitize=shift-exponent` finds the ones that are REACHED;
                 this pass finds the ones that exist.
                 Worked instance: objects.c's `settings->tajFlags |= 1 << (j+31)`.

The parser is a brace matcher over comment-stripped text, not a C front end. That
is a deliberate trade: it has no include paths, no macro expansion and no build to
keep working, so it runs on any checkout in under a second and cannot silently stop
covering a file. It is validated the only way that matters -- SELFTEST below pins
the known instances, so a parser regression that stopped finding them fails loudly
instead of reporting "0 findings, all clear".

Usage:
    tools/sweep_bug_shapes.py                       # all three classes
    tools/sweep_bug_shapes.py bare-pointer -v
    tools/sweep_bug_shapes.py --selftest            # prove the parser still sees
                                                    # the known instances
Output is one `class|file|line|key|text` record per finding, sorted, for
tests/check_array_bounds_sweep.py to diff against its triage list. That check
runs `--selftest` first; either mode exits non-zero when a file was parsed
incompletely, so a shortfall can never read as "0 findings, all clear".
