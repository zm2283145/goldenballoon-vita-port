# build_web.sh -- reproducible WebGPU browser build, staged into dist/web/.
#
# Produces the bring-your-own-ROM browser build: wasm + loader + the shell that
# lets the player pick their own ROM file locally. The ROM is read in the browser
# and never uploaded; nothing ROM-derived is ever written into dist/web/.
#
# The last step runs tools/check_no_rom.sh, which fails closed if any staged
# artifact contains N64 ROM header magic. That guard is what makes the
# bring-your-own-ROM claim checkable rather than merely asserted, so this script
# refuses to finish without it passing.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/web/build_web.sh                 # uses emcmake from PATH
#   EMSDK_DIR=~/emsdk tools/web/build_web.sh
#   tools/web/build_web.sh --clean

# ---- provenance stamp -------------------------------------------------------

# live?" always has an answer. The demo repo is a publication target with no
# source in it, which makes this stamp the ONLY link back to the code -- see
# docs/DEMO_REPO.md. `dirty` is recorded honestly rather than hidden; the
# publisher refuses to publish a dirty tree without an explicit override.
# Composed before staging so writing it cannot fail on anything but I/O; the
# version it names was reconciled with CMakeLists above. The publisher stamps
# that version onto <html data-build-version> so a backup exported in the
# browser records the same product version the native tools write into theirs.
