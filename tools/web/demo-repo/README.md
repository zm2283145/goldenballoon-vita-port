# Golden Balloon — web demo

**▶ Play: https://akratch.github.io/golden-balloon/**

> **Two repositories, one project — the hyphen matters:**
>
> - **This repository, [`akratch/golden-balloon`](https://github.com/akratch/golden-balloon),
>   contains the generated playable web build only.**
> - **For the native/desktop app, downloads, source code, and development, go to
>   [`akratch/goldenballoon`](https://github.com/akratch/goldenballoon).**
>
> Code changes belong in the non-hyphenated source repository, not here.

A native source port of the 1997 Nintendo 64 kart racer, compiled to WebGPU and
running entirely in your browser.

> ### Bring your own ROM
>
> **This repository contains no ROM and no game assets** — no textures, audio,
> music, models or level data, and none in its history. You supply a copy of the
> original game that you legally own and dumped yourself.
>
> Your ROM is read **locally in your browser**. It is never uploaded — the site is
> static and there is no server to receive it.

## What this repository is

A **publication target**, nothing more. It holds only built artifacts:

| | |
|---|---|
| `mdkr64_web.wasm` / `.js` | the compiled engine |
| `mdkr64_web.js.symbols` | the symbol map from that exact link, so a crash trace can be read |
| `mdkr-save-tools.wasm` / `.js` | the ROM- and renderer-free save codec/editor module |
| `index.html`, `style.css`, `mdkr64-shell.js`, `mdkr-save-ui.js` | the launcher shell and local save-management UI |
| `rom-id.js` | identifies and normalises your ROM in the page, before the shell loads |
| `sw.js`, `manifest.webmanifest` | build-scoped service worker and install metadata, so the page works offline from the home screen |
| `assets/` | project brand art |
| `build-info.json` | which source commit produced this build |

**There is no source code here** — no decompiled game code, no engine source.

## Do not send pull requests here

This repo is generated. Its contents are overwritten wholesale on every publish, so
any change made here is silently lost. Issues about *gameplay* are welcome; code
changes have to happen in the
[`goldenballoon` source repository](https://github.com/akratch/goldenballoon).

## Requirements

A WebGPU browser. Chrome or Edge 113+ is the qualified path; a WebGPU-enabled
Firefox or Safari is capability-detected and can also work. There is no WebGL
fallback; the page tells you up front rather than rendering black. Save backup,
import, editing, and recovery remain available when WebGPU is missing; they do
not load the game engine or require a ROM.
