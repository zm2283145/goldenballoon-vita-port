# publish_demo.sh -- ONE-WAY publisher from this source repo into the public demo
# repo. Nothing else may ever write to the demo repo.
#
# WHY TWO REPOS: GitHub Pages from a private repo needs a paid plan, so a public
# demo requires a public repo. Rather than publishing the whole source tree, the
# demo repo carries ONLY built artifacts (wasm, loader, shell, brand assets) plus
# its own README/LICENSE/DISCLAIMER. No decompiled game code, no ROM, no assets.
#
# THE CONTRACT (see docs/DEMO_REPO.md):
#   1. One direction only. The demo repo is a publication target, never a source
#      of truth. Never hand-edit it -- this script overwrites its payload wholesale
#      and any local edit there is silently lost.
#   2. Every publish is provenance-stamped with the exact source commit, in three
#      places: dist/web/build-info.json, the page footer, and the demo commit
#      message. That stamp is the only link from the live site back to code.
#   3. Fail closed. A dirty source tree, a failed ROM guard, or an oversized wasm
#      aborts the publish rather than shipping something that corresponds to no
#      commit.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/web/publish_demo.sh --demo ../golden-balloon-demo            # stage + commit
#   tools/web/publish_demo.sh --demo ../golden-balloon-demo --push     # and push
#   tools/web/publish_demo.sh --demo DIR --allow-dirty                 # explicit override
#   tools/web/publish_demo.sh --demo DIR --no-build                    # reuse dist/web

$tools_note
Source commit: $SRC_SHA
Source subject: $SRC_SUBJECT

Built artifacts only -- no decompiled game code, no ROM, no game assets. The
player supplies their own ROM, which is read client-side and never uploaded.
Verified by tools/check_no_rom.sh in the source repo before publishing.

DO NOT EDIT THIS REPO BY HAND. It is a publication target; the publisher
overwrites its payload wholesale and any local change is lost.
