# check_no_rom.sh -- FAIL-CLOSED guard: no shipped artifact may contain ROM data.
#
# This is the mechanism that keeps a public release in the clear. Golden Balloon is
# bring-your-own-ROM: the user supplies a copy they legally own, it is read on
# their machine (in the browser build, entirely client-side and never uploaded),
# and nothing ROM-derived is ever redistributed. This script is what proves that
# claim about a build instead of merely asserting it.
#
# Mirrors the mgb64 web-demo ROM-absence guard. Two independent checks per file:
#
#   1. HEADER MAGIC AT OFFSET 0, in all three N64 byte orders -- catches a ROM
#      renamed onto a whitelisted artifact name:
#         80 37 12 40  .z64  big-endian (the on-disk form the engine loads)
#         37 80 40 12  .v64  byteswapped
#         40 12 37 80  .n64  little-endian
#   2. THE BIG-ENDIAN MAGIC SEQUENCE ANYWHERE in the file -- catches ROM content
#      appended to, or embedded inside, an artifact (e.g. baked into a wasm blob).
#
# Why not just grep for the game's name: the engine legitimately contains ROM
# validation strings, so a plain string search false-positives. The header magic is
# structural, so it does not.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/check_no_rom.sh dist/web            # scan a directory (recursively)
#   tools/check_no_rom.sh dist/web/a.wasm ... # scan specific files
#   tools/check_no_rom.sh                     # default: dist/web
#
# Exit 0 = clean and safe to publish. Exit 1 = STOP, do not publish.
