# check_clean_room.sh -- FAIL-CLOSED guard: the repository itself must be clean-room.
#
# tools/check_no_rom.sh proves a *shipped artifact* carries no ROM data. This script
# proves the complementary claim that no ROM or bulk ROM-derived asset data is
# in the repository or its history. A ROM committed and then deleted in a later
# commit is still in the clone forever, and no artifact scan would ever see it.
# The separate release-readiness guard audits every media filename against the
# exact current/historical allowlists documented in NOTICE.md.
#
# Checks:
#   1. No ROM-extension file is TRACKED (all three N64 byte orders).
#   2. No ROM-extension file was EVER ADDED in any commit on any ref.
#   3. No blob anywhere in history carries an N64 ROM header at offset 0.
#   4. No blob in history is implausibly large for source (default 4 MiB) -- a
#      backstop for ROM-derived bulk (asset dumps, captures) under an innocent name.
#   5. No emulator source is vendored (the visual oracle patches ares out-of-tree).
#   6. .gitignore still covers ROMs in all three byte orders, saves, and captures.
#
# Usage:  tools/check_clean_room.sh
# Exit 0 = clean-room claim holds. Exit 1 = STOP, do not publish.
# -e is on so an unanticipated command failure aborts rather than being scored as
# a passing check. Every site below where a NON-ZERO status is the expected clean
# outcome (a grep that finds nothing, a reader that closes a git pipe early) is
# guarded with an explicit `|| true`; without those guards -e plus pipefail makes
# a clean repository exit 1 at check 2.
